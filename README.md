ANDS-Registry-Core
==================

Repository of Online Services (currently maintained by the Australian National Data Service) http://services.ands.org.au/

### ANDS Repository Structure

The ANDS Online Services software codebase is structured in a number of seperate software repositories, isolating different areas of functionality which might reasonably be expected to be deployed individually:

- (this repository) `au-research/ANDS-Registry-Core` - the core PHP codebase which includes a metadata registry, front-end portal and access management system
- `au-research/ANDS-Registry-Contrib` - non-core addons including CMS editor, widget libraries, identifier management front-end and other self-contained community-sourced contributions.
- `au-research/ANDS-Harvester` - a Java-based Tomcat web application used to schedule and harvest metadata from remote providers (over HTTP and OAI-PMH).
- `au-research/ANDS-PIDS-Service` - a Java-based Tomcat web application which provides an API layer implemented around the CNRI Handle service.
- `au-research/ANDS-RIFCS-API` - a Java library which provides a wrapper around the DOM methods required to manipulate and produce RIFCS documents.
