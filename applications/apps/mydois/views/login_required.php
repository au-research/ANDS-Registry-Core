		<div class="box-content">
<p>In order to use the Doi Query Tool users are required to have a user name and password that is valid within the Australian Access Federation (AAF). For more information on AAF accounts please see the ANDS website http://ands.org.au/resource/obtain-aaf-account.html.</p>
<p>If you haven't used ANDS Online Services before, you will be required to add yourself to an organisation upon login. If your organisation doesnâ€™t exist in the system you are able to add a new one. Organisational roles and the organisation's associated DOI client application identifier are used within the ANDS DOI Query Tool to control access. A logged in user can access and manage any DOIs created under the organisation they are a member of. This allows multiple users from the same organisation to manage the organisation's DOIs.</p>
<p>If you are having trouble logging in please see the ANDS FAQ http://ands.org.au/resource/ands-faq.html.</p>
