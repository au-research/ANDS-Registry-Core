<p>In order to publish and manage vocabularies within the ANDS Vocabulary Discovery Portal users are required to have a user name and password that is valid within the Australian Access Federation (AAF). For more information on AAF accounts please see the ANDS website http://ands.org.au/resource/obtain-aaf-account.html.</p>
<p>If you haven’t used ANDS Online Services before, you will be required to add yourself to an organisation upon login. If your organisation doesn’t exist in the system you are able to add a new one. Organisational roles are used within the ANDS Vocabulary Discovery Portal to control access to vocabularies. A logged in user can access and manage any vocabulary created under the organisation they are a member of. This allows multiple users from the same organisation to manage the organisation's vocabularies.</p>
<p>If you are having trouble logging in please see the ANDS FAQ http://ands.org.au/resource/ands-faq.html.</p>
