	<h1>About Research Data Australia</h1>
	<!-- <h2>A Window on the Australian Research Data Commons</h2>
	<p>Research Data Australia is a mesh of searchable web pages describing (and where possible linking to) Australian research data collections. Research Data Australia is provided by the <a href="http://www.ands.org.au">Australian National Data Service (ANDS)</a>.</p>
	<p>ANDS seeks to support public access to as much publicly funded research data as can be provided within the constraints of privacy, copyright and technology.</p>
	<p>ANDS is supported by the Australian Government through the <a href="http://ncris.innovation.gov.au/">National Collaborative Research Infrastructure Strategy Program</a> and the Education Investment Fund (EIF) Super Science Initiative.</p> -->

	<p>Research Data Australia, the flagship service of the Australian National
	Data Service  (<a href="http://ands.org.au" target="_blank">ANDS</a>), provides a comprehensive window into the
	Australian Research Data Commons.</p>

	<p>Research Data Australia is an Internet-based discovery service designed to
	provide rich connections between data, projects, researchers and
	institutions, and promote visibility of Australian research data
	collections in search engines.</p>

	<p>ANDS is partnering with research institutions and data producing agencies to
	bring about four transformations to data - unmanaged to managed, disconnected
	to connected, invisible to findable and single use to reusable - that will
	enable Australia's research data to become a national strategic resource to
	support better, more efficient and defensible research, and improved policy
	input.</p>

	<p>ANDS is funded by the Australian Government through the National
	Collaborative Research Infrastructure Strategy (<a href="http://ncris.innovation.gov.au" target="_blank">NCRIS</a>)</p>
