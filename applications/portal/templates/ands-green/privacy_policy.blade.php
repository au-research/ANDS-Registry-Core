                       The following document sets forth the Privacy Policy for the ARDC website Research Data Australia,
                       <a href="http://researchdata.ands.org.au">http://researchdata.ands.org.au</a>.
                   </p>

                   <p>
                       The ARDC is bound by the <a href="http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2013C00482">Privacy Act 1988</a> (Privacy Act),
                       which sets out a number of principles concerning the privacy of individuals.
                   </p>

                   <h3>Non-personally identifiable information</h3>
                   <p>
                       For each visitor to reach the site, we collect non-personally identifiable information, including
                       but not limited to browser type, version and language, operating system, pages viewed while
                       browsing the site, page access times, search terms used and referring website address.
                   </p>
                   <h3>Use of non-personally identifiable information</h3>
                   <p>
                       The non-personally identifiable information collected will be used for the purpose of gauging
                       visitor traffic, trends analysis and delivering personalised content to you while you are at the
                       site.  We will also use the aggregated data, in its entirety or in a time-based scale, to provide
                       statistics to our users and our partners. These statistics can either be displayed in Research
                       Data Australia (e.g. views, access) or as a report shared with our partners and stakeholders.
                   </p>
                   <h3>Collection of your personal information</h3>
                   <p>There are many aspects of the site which can be viewed without providing personal information,
                       however, for access to certain features you are required to login via supported 3rd party
                       authorisation providers. Upon your approval, these 3rd party providers share profile information
                       about you with the ARDC and Research Data Australia. From this information the ARDC will collect and
                       store your name, unique provider ID and if available a link to your profile image.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                       From time to time, we may use customer information for new, unanticipated uses not previously
                       disclosed in our privacy notice. If our information practices change at some time in the future,
                       we will update this policy, and  only data collected from the time of the policy change will be
                       used  for those new purposes.
                   </p>
                   <h3>Sharing of your personal information</h3>
                   <p>
                       The ARDC will not disclose or on sell any personal information obtained through your login and use of
                       Research Data Australia. Data collected will only be used in the context of your logged in
                       Research Data Australia session and to improve our website and services.
                   </p>
                   <h3>Changes to this Privacy Policy</h3>
