                   <!-- <h2>A Window on the Australian Research Data Commons</h2>
                   <p>Research Data Australia is a mesh of searchable web pages describing (and where possible linking to) Australian research data collections. Research Data Australia is provided by the <a href="http://www.ands.org.au">Australian National Data Service (ANDS)</a>.</p>
                   <p>ANDS seeks to support public access to as much publicly funded research data as can be provided within the constraints of privacy, copyright and technology.</p>
                   <p>ANDS is supported by the Australian Government through the <a href="http://ncris.innovation.gov.au/">National Collaborative Research Infrastructure Strategy Program</a> and the Education Investment Fund (EIF) Super Science Initiative.</p> -->

                   <p>Research Data Australia, the flagship service of the Australian National
                       Data Service  (<a href="http://ands.org.au" target="_blank">ANDS</a>), provides a comprehensive window into the
                       Australian Research Data Commons.</p>

                   <p>Research Data Australia is an Internet-based discovery service designed to
                       provide rich connections between data, projects, researchers and
                       institutions, and promote visibility of Australian research data
                       collections in search engines.</p>

                   <p>ANDS is partnering with research institutions and data producing agencies to
                       bring about four transformations to data - unmanaged to managed, disconnected
                       to connected, invisible to findable and single use to reusable - that will
                       enable Australia's research data to become a national strategic resource to
                       support better, more efficient and defensible research, and improved policy
                       input.</p>

                   <p>ANDS is funded by the Australian Government through the National
                       Collaborative Research Infrastructure Strategy (<a href="https://education.gov.au/national-collaborative-research-infrastructure-strategy-ncris" target="_blank">NCRIS</a>).</p>
