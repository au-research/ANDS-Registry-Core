					<h3>A service built on sharing</h3>
					<p>
						Research Vocabularies Australia helps you find, access, and reuse vocabularies for research.
                        Some vocabularies are hosted by the Australian National Data Service (ANDS) and can be accessed directly through Research Vocabularies Australia.
                        Otherwise Research Vocabularies Australia provides a link to the vocabulary ownerâ€™s web page.
					</p>
                    <p>Research Vocabularies Australia also allows you to <a href="https://vocabs.ands.org.au/vocabs/page/contribute">create and/or publish a vocabulary </a>
                        as well as <a href="https://vocabs.ands.org.au/vocabs/page/use">integrate an existing vocabulary into your own system</a>.

					<h3>Vocabularies for the research community</h3>
					<p>
