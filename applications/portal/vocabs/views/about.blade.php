					<h3>A service built on sharing</h3>
					<p>
						Research Vocabularies Australia helps you find, access, and reuse vocabularies for research. Some vocabularies are hosted by ANDS and can be accessed directly through Research Vocabularies Australia.  Otherwise Research Vocabularies Australia provides a link to the vocabulary ownerâ€™s web page.

					<h3>Vocabularies for the research community</h3>
