Bootstro.js
========

Tiny JS library taking advantage of bootstrap's popover to help guide your users around. <a href='http://clu3.github.com/bootstro.js'>Demo</a>


Requires
========

Bootstrap 2.3.1 + jQuery. 
There's an <a href='https://github.com/clu3/bootstro.js/issues/6'>issue</a> that it doesn't work with Bootstrap 2.0.4. 
My development setup is always latest bootstrap (currently 2.3.1, as of 20th March, 2013) so I can't really tell.
If you don't want to work with Bootstrap, check out <a href='https://github.com/usablica/intro.js'>intro.js</a>. 

Documentation
========

I'm not so much into markdown so please see <a href='http://clu3.github.com/bootstro.js'>Documentation</a> on the demo page

tl;dr
----

For the concerned/curious about stealing idea of intro.js or copyright or anything like that: Bootstro.js was conceived about 2 months before it was released and 
publicly discussed (by me) <a href='http://irc.jquery.org/%23jquery/%23jquery_20130309.log.html#t00:06:34'>1 day before</a> intro.js's <a href='https://github.com/usablica/intro.js/commit/804ea9494c906503dc5602b1205bde5d937f7cf7'>first commit</a>.

A spaghetti working version was also finished few days before that as part of SandPHP (private repo), but Bootstro.js was made opensourced after intro.js's debut in HN
Just so you get the picture. 

I'm an advocate for opensource, but I hate licences, copyright and all that shit. Seriously, if it's opensource it should be completely free, no lisence or liability or whatsoever attached. I hate to put a license to this tiny utility, it's too small and simple to have one. Bootstrap already does like 99% of the work. But sigh, that's the way it currently is so as advised I add to put MIT license to this "library", basically that's the most "free" license around.
