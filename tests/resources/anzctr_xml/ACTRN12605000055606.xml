            <Comparison>This is a comparison study and aims to compare the two ranges within the
                normal clinical practice of 85-95% oxygen saturations. At the moment neither the
                Lower (85-89%) nor the Higher Oxygen Saturations (91-95%) is seen as the standard,
                and the purpose of the study is to compare both against each other in order to
                determine the ideal target within that range.</Comparison>

                    <Outcome>Prior to unblinding the data for analysis, a Statistical Analysis Plan
                        was produced and signed off by Prof Tarnow-Mordi, Dr Adrienne Kirby and Prof
                        Val Gebski on 10th February, 2014. A specific process for determining the
                        primary outcome of death or disability was included, as follows (Section
                        5.5.) Infants will be classified as having had the primary endpoint if (a)
                        they have died prior to 2 years corrected gestational age; or (b) assessment
                        at 2 years corrected gestational age shows major disability. If an infant’s
                        survival status at 2 years is unknown, or they are known to be alive but
                        information on major disability is not available, their primary outcome will
                        be missing. The classification of infants as having a major disability is
                        determined from: * Bayley III Developmental Assessment completed by a
                        blinded psychologist; or in some cases Bayley II Developmental Assessment *
                        Health Status assessment completed by a blinded paediatrician; or in some
                        cases a Short Health Status Questionnaire collected mainly via phone call to
                        parents or a GP visit if this is not available An infant will be classified
                        as having major disability if they are alive at 2 years corrected
                        gestational age and meet at least one of the following criteria: * Cerebral
                        palsy with GMFCS level &amp;gt;= 2, as indicated on the health status (Q29)
                        or short health status (Q1) assessments * Legal blindness, as indicated on
                        the on the health status (Q7) or short health status (Q2) assessments *
                        Hearing loss requiring hearing aids, as indicated on the health status (Q11)
                        or short health status (Q3) assessments * Composite cognitive score &amp;lt;
                        85 or composite language score &amp;lt; 85 on the Bayley III assessment; or
                        cognition Mental Development Index (MDI) &amp;lt; 70 on the Bayley II
                        assessment If cognitive disability cannot be determined because the relevant
                        Bayley III or Bayley II items are missing, the final criterion above can be
                        replaced by any one of the following from the health status assessment: *
                        Uses less than 10 words (Q13); or language problems indicated on the short
                        health assessment (Q4) * Delayed development by more than 12 months (Q32) *
                        Other severe impairment (Q34) If the infant does not meet any of the first
                        three criteria, and all information on the Bayley assessment and these
                        substitute criteria is also missing, the infant’s primary endpoint status
                        will be missing.</Outcome>

                <briefsummary>Oxygen is the commonest neonatal therapy. Unfortunately, both too much
                    and too little oxygen may be harmful for very premature infants. We now measure
                    the oxygen in a baby's blood by oxygen saturation but the optimum range in the
                    first few weeks is unknown and no randomised controlled trial (RCT) has
                    addressed this question. This proposal is for Australian arm of a major
                    international study involving 5000 babies, born at less than 28 weeks, to
                    address this question. Babies will be randomised to a higher or lower target
                    range of oxygen saturation from birth (85-89% or 91-95%). For all oximeters
                    staff will target a masked range of 88-92%. We will assess which of the two
                    target ranges is associated with the best overall outcome, which is a composite
                    measure of survival, disability on a standard test of neurodevelopment (Bayley
                    scales), and visual function at 2 years of age.</briefsummary>
