                chemotherapy (standard chemotherapy involves a combination of cisplatin or
                carboplatin with one of the following drugs - vinorelbine, paclitaxel, pemetrexed or
                gemcitabine). Each patient's specific treatment regime will be determined by the
                participant's doctor. Nitroglycerin is administered as a 25mg patch for 12 hours
                each day for 2 days before, the day of, and for two days after each chemotherapy
                injection. Treatment with the chemotherapy and Nitroglycerin will last for 6
                treatment cycles (each cycle lasts for 3 weeks)</InterventionExposure>

                <briefsummary>This study will evaluate the efficacy of adding the drug,
                    nitroglycerin, to first line chemotherapy for advanced non-small cell lung
                    cancer. Who is it for? You may be eligible to join this study if you are 18
                    years or above and have a confirmed diagnosis of stage III or IV non-small cell
                    lung cancer. Radiotherapy should have been completed at least one week before
                    commencing treatment in this study. Trial details Participants in this trial
                    will be randomly (by chance) allocated to one of two groups. Both groups undergo
                    6 x 3 week treatment cycles of standard chemotherapy determined by their doctor.
                    In addition, participants in group one will receive nitroglycerin administered
                    as a 25mg patch for 12 hours each day for 2 days before, the day of, and for two
                    days after each chemotherapy injection. Participants will undergo regular visits
                    to the hospital and undergo CT scans prior to treatment, every six weeks during
                    chemotherapy, and every two months after chemotherapy until the lung cancer has
                    progressed. This will help determine which treatment is more effective in terms
                    of progression-free survival and overall survival.</briefsummary>
