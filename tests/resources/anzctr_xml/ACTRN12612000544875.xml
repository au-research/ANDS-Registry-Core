            <InterventionExposure>The intervention is an online training program designed
                specifically for this study. The training, entitled ‘Men in Mind’, is designed for
                mental health practitioners working with men. Since men engage in psychological
                treatment at lower rates than women, the goal of the training is to increase
                clinicians’ competence and confidence in providing psychological treatment to male
                clients. Participants assigned to the intervention group will be provided access to
                the training for a period of six (6) weeks. The training is conducted entirely
                online, in a self-paced format, and is estimated to take 8 hours to complete. The
                training program consists of five modules comprising content such as: male client
                and clinician gender socialisation and the interaction between these in practice;
                engagement and motivation strategies for male clients; and identifying and
                responding effectively to male distress and suicidality in counselling. Each of the
                five modules contains a mix of text- and video-based content delivery (41 videos
                across the course), presented alongside engaging imagery throughout. A number of
                learning design tools have been included in the training program to facilitate
                engagement and participants’ learning. Furthermore, the trial design includes
                regular communication with participants in order to encourage engagement and improve
                adherence.</InterventionExposure>

                <briefsummary>The aim of this project is to evaluate the efficacy of an online
                    training program for mental health clinicians. The training is called Men in
                    Mind, and focuses on engaging male clients in therapy and responding effectively
                    to men’s distress and suicidality. The project will also evaluate the cost of
                    the intervention per user. The online ~8 hour, 5 module training program has
                    been developed in consultation with international experts in men’s mental
                    health, and is designed to be a leading evidence-based resource for clinicians
                    to develop skills and knowledge in male-specific adaptations to treatment. The
                    project represents a partnership between Movember (leading the delivery of the
                    intervention), and Orygen/Centre for Youth Mental Health, The University of
                    Melbourne (leading the evaluation of the intervention). The online data
                    management system will be managed by our sub-contractor, Strategic Data Ltd. The
                    effectiveness of Men in Mind will be evaluated in a waitlist-controlled
                    randomised superiority trial. Intervention group participants will complete
                    self-report and vignette-based assessments before the training, and 6 weeks
                    after they complete the training, in addition to 3-months / 12-weeks follow-up.
                    Control group participants will receive access to the training following a
                    6-week waiting period, and after completion of pre-training and post-waitlist
                    assessments. The primary outcome will be whether Men in Mind training
                    participants, relative to waitlist control participants, display more greatly
                    improved self-reported capacity to engage male clients at 6 weeks post-training
                    according to the Engaging Men in Therapy Scale (EMITS).</briefsummary>
