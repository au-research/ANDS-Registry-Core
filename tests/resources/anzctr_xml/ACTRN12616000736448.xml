            <InterventionExposure>Patients randomised to no screening will not undergo regular
                non-invasive testing for CAD while on the kidney transplant waitlist. The current
                practice for waitlisted patients is to be screened every 1-2 years based on
                perceived risk of CAD. At any time, if patients develop symptoms of CAD, they will
                be treated according to local standard of care. Patients in this group will be
                contacted every 6 months on the wait-list, and at 3 and 12 months post-transplant.
                The duration of the study will be 5 years.</InterventionExposure>

            <Comparison>Patients randomised to routine screening will undergo noninvasive testing
                for coronary artery disease every year or second yearly as determined by local
                transplant centre practice. The duration of screening in the control is same as the
                intervention group (5 years). Patients transplanted during the study will be
                followed for 12 months post-date of transplant and will exit study. This applies for
                both SCREENING and NO SCREENING groups.</Comparison>

                        the following: cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, emergency
                        revascularisation, hospitalisation with unstable angina. The outcome will be
                        assessed by: 1) Notification to the transplant coordinators when patients
                        are admitted in hospital (this is the usual standard of care in wait-listed
                        patients). 2) The trial coordinator will gather electronic medical records,
                        letters. procedure notes and will fill in the relevant case record form on
                        the REDCap database (managed by Sydney local health district). All data are
                        encrypted and stored on servers at SLHD, where it is backed up. 3) Patients
                        will be followed up 6 monthly (alternating by phone and clinic visits) where
                        trial coordinators will discuss any hospitalisations with the
                        patients.</Outcome>

                <briefsummary>Cardiovascular disease is the commonest cause of death while on the
                    kidney transplant waiting list and after transplantation. Current standard care
                    involves screening for coronary artery disease prior to waitlist entry, then
                    every 1-2 years, according to perceived risk, until transplanted. The aim of
                    screening is two-fold. Firstly to identify patients with asymptomatic coronary
                    disease to enable either correction, by bypass surgery or angioplasty, or
                    removal of the patient from the list, with the ultimate aim of preventing
                    premature cardiovascular mortality at the time of, or soon after kidney
                    transplantation. Secondly, from a societal perspective, to prevent mis-direction
                    of scarce donor organs into recipients who experience early mortality. This
                    current screening strategy is not evidence based, has substantial known and
                    potential harms, and is very costly. Two major issues of uncertainty require
                    addressing in sequence: (1) whether to periodically screen asymptomatic
                    wait-listed patients for occult coronary artery disease; and (2) whether to
                    revascularise coronary stenoses in asymptomatic patients prior to
                    transplantation. The CARSK study seeks to address the first of these 2 issues.
                    CARSK aims to 1. Test the hypothesis that after screening for wait list entry,
                    no further screening for coronary artery disease (CAD) is non-inferior to the
                    current standard care which is screening all asymptomatic wait-listed patients
                    for CAD at regular intervals. 2. Compare the benefits and costs of not screening
                    versus regular CAD screening from a health system perspective. </briefsummary>
