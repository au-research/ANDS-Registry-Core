        "description": "<p>This dataset includes a suite of pre-seismic  2m resolution DEMs pre-dating the 2013 Mw7.7 Baluchistan earthquake. The DEMs were constructed using the open-source software package SETSM (https://mjremotesensing.wordpress.com/setsm/) from DigitalGlobe base imagery (&copy;DigitalGlobe 2018). DEMs were mosaicked and vertically registered using the Ames StereoPipeline (https://ti.arc.nasa.gov/tech/asr/groups/intelligent-robotics/ngt/stereo/).<\/p>  <p> The base imagery included 0.5m and 0.3m resolution panchromatic imagery from QuickBird, GEOEYE, WorldView1, WorldView2, and WorldView3 (&copy;DigitalGlobe 2018). The dataset includes DEMs generated from in-track stereo imagery, as well as DEMs constructed from mixed pairs of non-in-track stereo images. The pre-event DEMs are all vertically registered to the 30 m Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) DEM.  The generation of this dataset was funded by NASA in cooperation with the U.S. Geological Survey. A complete description of the generation of this dataset and the images that were used to construct the DEMs can be found in the associated manuscript: <br /><br /> Barnhart WD, Gold RD, Shea HN, Peterson KE, Briggs RW, Harbor DJ (2019) Vertical coseismic offsets derived from high-resolution stereogrammetric DSM differencing: The 2013 Baluchistan, Pakistan earthquake, <i>JGR-Solid Earth<\/i>  <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1029/2018JB017107\">DOI:10.1029/2018JB017107<\/a><br /><br />   The naming convention of individual DEMs is detailed in the metadata.<\/p> <p><b>Note: The source data for this project are the individual 2 meter DEMs that were constructed with the SETSM open-source software (described above).  However, in order to utilize the OpenTopography webmap interface, these DEMs were mosaiced into a single seamless mosaic of pre-earthquake topography.  Details on how this single mosaic was created are in the metadata.  Users are cautioned that files created using the webmap interface will use the averaged, mosaic data.  For certain applications, users may wish to utilize the source datasets by downloading the original DEMs via the \"Source\" directory under the \"Bulk Download\" section of the OpenTopography website.<\/b><\/p>",

        "description": "<p>This dataset includes a suite of post-seismic 2m resolution DEMs post-dating the 2013 Mw7.7 Baluchistan earthquake. The DEMs were constructed using the open-source software package SETSM (https://mjremotesensing.wordpress.com/setsm/) from DigitalGlobe base imagery (&copy;DigitalGlobe 2018). DEMs were mosaicked and vertically registered using the Ames StereoPipeline (https://ti.arc.nasa.gov/tech/asr/groups/intelligent-robotics/ngt/stereo/).<\/p>    <p> The base imagery included 0.5m and 0.3m resolution panchromatic imagery from QuickBird, GEOEYE, WorldView1, WorldView2, and WorldView3 (&copy;DigitalGlobe 2018). The dataset includes DEMs generated from in-track stereo imagery, as well as DEMs constructed from mixed pairs of non-in-track stereo images.   The post-event DEMs are not vertically registered to a pre-existing DEM in order to avoid removal of relative co-seismic offsets between the pre- and post-event pairs.  The generation of this dataset was funded by NASA in cooperation with the U.S. Geological Survey. A complete description of the generation of this dataset and the images that were used to construct the DEMs can be found in the associated manuscript: <br /><br />  Barnhart WD, Gold RD, Shea HN, Peterson KE, Briggs RW, Harbor DJ (2019) Vertical coseismic offsets derived from high-resolution stereogrammetric DSM differencing: The 2013 Baluchistan, Pakistan earthquake, <i>JGR-Solid Earth.<\/i>  <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1029/2018JB017107\">DOI:10.1029/2018JB017107<\/a><br /><br />  The naming convention of individual DEMs is detailed in the metadata.<\/p>  <p><b>Note: The source data for this project are the individual 2 meter DEMs that were constructed with the SETSM open-source software (described above).  However, in order to utilize the OpenTopography webmap interface, these DEMs were mosaiced into a single seamless mosaic of post-earthquake topography.  Details on how this single mosaic was created are in the metadata.  Users are cautioned that files created using the webmap interface will use the averaged, mosaic data.  For certain applications, users may wish to utilize the source datasets by downloading the original DEMs via the \"Source\" directory under the \"Bulk Download\" section of the OpenTopography website.<\/b><\/p>",

Model shows numerous volcanic features including the main breached edifice, rafted edifice material on lava flow, several well preserved conical vents, and many bombs in the proximal setting. In addition, numerous fractures are evident cutting the main edifice without much tephra cover, indicating their late stage development. Work in progress by Zawacki, et al. is reconstructing the last eruption from Tecolote and suggests an eruption age of 20-40ka. Data were collected by a team from ASU and Oklahoma State University composed of: Scott, C.P., Scott, T., Lao-Davila, D.A., Clarke, A.B., Arrowsmith, J.R., and Lynch, D.",

Model shows numerous volcanic features including the main breached edifice, rafted edifice material on lava flow, several well preserved conical vents, and many bombs in the proximal setting. In addition, numerous fractures are evident cutting the main edifice without much tephra cover, indicating their late stage development. Work in progress by Zawacki, et al. is reconstructing the last eruption from Tecolote and suggests an eruption age of 20-40ka. Data were collected by a team from ASU and Oklahoma State University composed of: Scott, C.P., Scott, T., Lao-Davila, D.A., Clarke, A.B., Arrowsmith, J.R., and Lynch, D.",

        "description": "<p>The 16 April 2016 M7 Kumamoto earthquake ruptured the Futagawa- Hinagu fault zone on Kyushu Island of southwestern Japan. The lidar dataset collected by Air Survey Co., Ltd., of Japan covers the western half of the rupture zone. The acquisition of the imagery closely brackets the timing of the earthquake: The pre-earthquake dataset was acquired on 15 April 2016 and the post-earthquake dataset was acquired on 23 April 2016.<\/p> <p>For more information on this dataset refer to the following publications: <ul><li>Scott, C.

The requested survey area is located approximately 11 km north of San Bernardino, CA. The polygon encloses approximately 62 km<sup>2<\/sup>. Note: A considerable percentage of the points in this dataset were classified as \"building\" (LAS class 6) although visual inspection indicates these points are mostly above-ground vegetation. For the purposes of distribution though OpenTopography, these points have been grouped with \"unclassified\" (LAS class 1) points to reduce point cloud classification to either \"ground\" or \"unclassified\" below.",

        "description": "<p>This data set is derived from the <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.5069/G97P8W9T\" target='_blank'> original 2005 B4 lidar dataset collected over the southern San Andreas and San Jacinto fault zones in southern California, USA<\/a>. These data have provided a fundamental resource for study of active faulting in southern California since they were released in 2005. However, these data were not classified in a manner that allowed for easy differentiation between bare ground surfaces and the objects and vegetation above that surface. This reprocessed (classified) dataset allows researchers easy and direct access to a \"bare-earth\" digital elevation data set as gridded half-meter resolution rasters (elevation and shaded relief), \"full-feature\" digital elevation models as gridded one-meter resolution rasters (elevation and shaded relief) and as classified (according to ASPRS standards) point clouds in binary .laz format, and a spatial index in shapefile and Google Earth KML format. The reprocessing  of the 2005 B4 dataset was performed by Dr. Stephen B DeLong, USGS Earthquake Hazards Program, as a service to the community. The data available here were originally published on the <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.5066/F7TQ5ZQ6\" target='_blank'>USGS  ScienceBase website as <i>Classified point cloud and gridded elevation data from the 2005 B4 Lidar Project, southern California, USA<\/i><\/a>.<\/p>  <p><u>Original B4 project description<\/u>: The B4 Lidar Project collected lidar point cloud data of the southern San Andreas and San Jacinto Faults in southern California. Data acquisition and processing were performed by the National Center for Airborne Laser Mapping (NCALM) in partnership with the USGS and Ohio State University through funding from the EAR Geophysics program at the National Science Foundation (NSF). Optech International contributed the ALTM3100 laser scanner system. UNAVCO and SCIGN assisted in GPS ground control and continuous high rate GPS data acquisition. A group of volunteers from USGS, UCSD, UCLA, Caltech and private industry, as well as gracious landowners along the fault zones, also made the project possible. If you utilize the B4 data for talks, posters or publications, we ask that you acknowledge the B4 project.

        "description": "<p>This data set is derived from the <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.5069/G97P8W9T\" target='_blank'> original 2005 B4 lidar dataset collected over the southern San Andreas and San Jacinto fault zones in southern California, USA<\/a>. These data have provided a fundamental resource for study of active faulting in southern California since they were released in 2005. However, these data were not classified in a manner that allowed for easy differentiation between bare ground surfaces and the objects and vegetation above that surface. This reprocessed (classified) dataset allows researchers easy and direct access to a \"bare-earth\" digital elevation data set as gridded half-meter resolution rasters (elevation and shaded relief), \"full-feature\" digital elevation models as gridded one-meter resolution rasters (elevation and shaded relief) and as classified (according to ASPRS standards) point clouds in binary .laz format, and a spatial index in shapefile and Google Earth KML format. The reprocessing  of the 2005 B4 dataset was performed by Dr. Stephen B DeLong, USGS Earthquake Hazards Program, as a service to the community. The data available here were originally published on the <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.5066/F7TQ5ZQ6\" target='_blank'>USGS  ScienceBase website as <i>Classified point cloud and gridded elevation data from the 2005 B4 Lidar Project, southern California, USA<\/i><\/a>.<\/p>  <p><u>Original B4 project description<\/u>: The B4 Lidar Project collected lidar point cloud data of the southern San Andreas and San Jacinto Faults in southern California. Data acquisition and processing were performed by the National Center for Airborne Laser Mapping (NCALM) in partnership with the USGS and Ohio State University through funding from the EAR Geophysics program at the National Science Foundation (NSF). Optech International contributed the ALTM3100 laser scanner system. UNAVCO and SCIGN assisted in GPS ground control and continuous high rate GPS data acquisition. A group of volunteers from USGS, UCSD, UCLA, Caltech and private industry, as well as gracious landowners along the fault zones, also made the project possible. If you utilize the B4 data for talks, posters or publications, we ask that you acknowledge the B4 project.

The primary objective of the Solana Beach Bluff Characterization Survey is to develop a baseline condition that can be compared to future surveys, allowing the City to monitor the bluff condition and to quantify coastal erosion. The information can also support coastal planning and engineering studies. The project consisted of 63 scans, all independently registered to surveyed control points. The parameters of the scans were set so the density of the scan point clouds was no more than 3\" minimum spacing on the bluff with a positional certainty of better than 3\". The polygon encloses an area of approximately 0.01 km<sup>2<\/sup>.",

The aim was to test what the highest achievable resolution of such airborne lidar would be by flying several overlapping grids with narrow linespacing (50m and 100m) at 250m AGL. Achieved point densities are between 100 and 200 points per sqm. 8cm pixel size aerial RGB imagery is also available from ARA.<\/p><p>The data consist of two sites (Site 1 and Site 2) which are 0.767sqkm and 2.297sqkm in size, respectively.<\/p><p>The project is a collaboration between the Australian NESP (National Environmental Science Program) Project 3.1.7 \"Gully rehabilitation\" (http://nesptropical.edu.au/index.php/round-3-projects/project-3-1-7/) and ARA who also jointly funded the data capture and processing.<\/p><p>It is important to understand that due to the nature of the terrain and the much higher point densities achieved, standard point classification will not yield the desired results in a perfect manner. Research on this data set is ongoing at the two partner organizations. Third party users of this data set are encouraged to contact the project team via jorg.hacker@airborneresearch.org.au.<\/p>",

        "description": "Airborne lidar was collected by NCALM for PI Dr. Hyongki Lee (University of Houston) over the Slumgullion Landslide, Colorado. This dataset includes data from survey three of three in the collection. Three surveys were conducted on July 3, 7, 10, 2015 (DOY 184, 188, 191).  <br><br>The Slumgullion Earthflow, a slow moving landslide, crawled down the valley about 700 years ago creating the 4 miles (6.4 km) long and 2,000 feet (610 m) wide mass. The earthflow lies a few miles south east of Lake City. The landmark site covers 1,291 acres (522 ha) and is owned by the US Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management. It is \"a striking example of mass wasting (the movement of large masses of earth material).\" Lake San Cristobal was dammed by the earthflow. The earthflow has been moving continuously for about 300 years over older stable rock. It moves at a rate of about 7 meters (23 feet) per year. <br>Slumgullion Earthflow. (2017, April 12).

Three surveys were conducted on July 3, 7, 10, 2015 (DOY 184, 188, 191).  <br><br>The Slumgullion Earthflow, a slow moving landslide, crawled down the valley about 700 years ago creating the 4 miles (6.4 km) long and 2,000 feet (610 m) wide mass. The earthflow lies a few miles south east of Lake City. The landmark site covers 1,291 acres (522 ha) and is owned by the US Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management. It is \"a striking example of mass wasting (the movement of large masses of earth material).\" Lake San Cristobal was dammed by the earthflow. The earthflow has been moving continuously for about 300 years over older stable rock. It moves at a rate of about 7 meters (23 feet) per year. <br>Slumgullion Earthflow. (2017, April 12).

It is \"a striking example of mass wasting (the movement of large masses of earth material).\" Lake San Cristobal was dammed by the earthflow. The earthflow has been moving continuously for about 300 years over older stable rock. It moves at a rate of about 7 meters (23 feet) per year. <br>Slumgullion Earthflow. (2017, April 12).

Three surveys were conducted on July 3, 7, 10, 2015 (DOY 184, 188, 191).  <br><br>The Slumgullion Earthflow, a slow moving landslide, crawled down the valley about 700 years ago creating the 4 miles (6.4 km) long and 2,000 feet (610 m) wide mass. The earthflow lies a few miles south east of Lake City. The landmark site covers 1,291 acres (522 ha) and is owned by the US Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management. It is \"a striking example of mass wasting (the movement of large masses of earth material).\" Lake San Cristobal was dammed by the earthflow. The earthflow has been moving continuously for about 300 years over older stable rock. It moves at a rate of about 7 meters (23 feet) per year. <br>Slumgullion Earthflow. (2017, April 12).

        "description": "This dataset was collected using the Optech Aquarius ALTM, a hybrid laser mapping system which collects simultaneous land and shallow water-depth measurements using a beam wavelength of 532 nm. <br><br>This dataset was collected by NCALM for PI Dr. William Dietrich, University of California, Berkeley. The Eel River CZO is a multi-disciplinary research collaborative based at the University of California, Berkeley. CZO research explores how biotic and abiotic factors interact in the near-surface environment (from bedrook to tree tops) and how these relationships impact environmental processes. <br><br>  The requested survey area consisted of a 1 km wide corridor, running for approximately 115 km along the Eel river.    This survey was performed with 3 airborne remote sensing mapping systems. Two of these systems are LiDAR systems: 1) Optech Gemini Airborne Laser Terrain Mapper (ALTM) (serial # 06SEN195) which is an infrared laser mapping sensor and 2) Optech Aquarius ALTM (serial # 11SEN279) which is a hybrid laser mapping system as it collects simultaneous land and shallow water-depth measurements. It operates in the green spectrum, thus enabling it to penetrate water. These two LiDAR mapping systems along with an Optech 12-bit full waveform digitizer were mounted consecutively in a twin-engine Piper PA-31-350 Navajo Chieftain (Tail Number N154WW). <br><br>The third airborne sensor was for Hyperspectral imaging. This portion of the survey was performed with a CASI-1500 - a push broom type hyperspectral imaging sensor sold by ITRES. It is mounted on a vibration isolated mount together with the Gemini LIDAR sensor.

        "description": "This dataset was collected using the Optech Gemini Airborne Laser Terrain Mapper (ALTM) using a beam wavelength of 1064 nm. <br><br>This dataset was collected by NCALM for PI Dr. William Dietrich, University of California, Berkeley. The Eel River CZO is a multi-disciplinary research collaborative based at the University of California, Berkeley. CZO research explores how biotic and abiotic factors interact in the near-surface environment (from bedrook to tree tops) and how these relationships impact environmental processes. <br><br>  The requested survey area consisted of a 1 km wide corridor, running for approximately 115 km along the Eel river.    This survey was performed with 3 airborne remote sensing mapping systems. Two of these systems are LiDAR systems: 1) Optech Gemini Airborne Laser Terrain Mapper (ALTM) (serial # 06SEN195) which is an infrared laser mapping sensor and 2) Optech Aquarius ALTM (serial # 11SEN279) which is a hybrid laser mapping system as it collects simultaneous land and shallow water-depth measurements. It operates in the green spectrum, thus enabling it to penetrate water. These two LiDAR mapping systems along with an Optech 12-bit full waveform digitizer were mounted consecutively in a twin-engine Piper PA-31-350 Navajo Chieftain (Tail Number N154WW). <br><br>The third airborne sensor was for Hyperspectral imaging. This portion of the survey was performed with a CASI-1500 - a push broom type hyperspectral imaging sensor sold by ITRES. It is mounted on a vibration isolated mount together with the Gemini LIDAR sensor. Hyperspectral data are available via <a href=\"https://cloud.sdsc.edu/v1/AUTH_opentopography/PC_Bulk/CA14_Dietrich_Hyperspectral/\">this link<\/a>.",

Two of these systems are LiDAR systems: 1) Optech Gemini Airborne Laser Terrain Mapper (ALTM) (serial # 06SEN195) which is an infrared laser mapping sensor and 2) Optech Aquarius ALTM (serial # 11SEN279) which is a hybrid laser mapping system as it collects simultaneous land and shallow water-depth measurements. It operates in the green spectrum, thus enabling it to penetrate water.  These two LiDAR mapping systems along with an Optech 12-bit full waveform digitizer were mounted consecutively in a twin-engine Piper PA-31-350 Navajo Chieftain (Tail Number N154WW).   <br><br>The third airborne sensor was for Hyperspectral imaging. This portion of the survey was performed with a CASI-1500 - a push broom type hyperspectral imaging sensor sold by ITRES. It is mounted on a vibration isolated mount together with the Gemini LIDAR sensor.",

As described by the <a href=\"http://global.jaxa.jp/\">Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency<\/a>: The Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) releases the global digital surface model (DSM) dataset with a horizontal resolution of approx. 30-meter mesh (1 arcsec) free of charge. The dataset has been compiled with images acquired by the Advanced Land Observing Satellite \"DAICHI\" (ALOS). The dataset is published based on the DSM dataset (5-meter mesh version) of the \"World 3D Topographic Data\", which is the most precise global-scale elevation data at this time, and its elevation precision is also at a world-leading level as a 30-meter mesh version. This dataset is expected to be useful for scientific research, education, as well as the private service sector that uses geospatial information.<br><br>    <b>Version: <\/b>May 2016: Global terrestrial region (within approx. 82 deg. of N/S latitudes) of Version 1 released (approx. 22,100 tiles)  <br><br><b>Note:<\/b> JAXA provides two versions of AW3D30 created from the original 5-meter mesh using different downsampling methods: average (provided here) and median (not available from OpenTopography).",

        "description": "This dataset was collected using the Optech Aquarius ALTM, a hybrid laser mapping system which collects simultaneous land and shallow water-depth measurements using a beam wavelength of 532 nm. <br><br>This dataset was collected by NCALM for PI Dr. Praveen Kumar, University of Illinois. Clear Creek is part of the Intensively Managed Landscapes (ILM) Critical Zone Observatory (CZO).  <br><br> The requested survey area consisted of two rectangles - called East and West - enclosing approximately 204 square kilometers along with their associated watercourse corridors. The West rectangle is located 35 km NW of Iowa City, Iowa and the East rectangle is located 10 km NW of the same city. <br><br>This survey was performed with 2 different LiDAR systems: 1) Optech Gemini Airborne Laser Terrain Mapper (ALTM) (available <a href=\"http://opentopo.sdsc.edu/lidarDataset?opentopoID=OTLAS.122016.26915.1\">here<\/a>) which is an infrared laser mapping sensor and 2) Optech Aquarius ALTM (this dataset) which is a hybrid laser mapping system as it collects simultaneous land and shallow water-depth measurements. It operates in the green spectrum, thus enabling it to penetrate water. These LiDAR mapping systems along with an Optech 12-bit full waveform digitizer were mounted consecutively in a twin-engine Piper PA- 31-350 Navajo Chieftain (Tail Number N154WW).   <br><br>Full waveform files are available via <a href=\"https://cloud.sdsc.edu/v1/AUTH_opentopography/PC_Bulk/IA14_Kumar_Waveform/\">this link<\/a>.",

It operates in the green spectrum, thus enabling it to penetrate water. These LiDAR mapping systems along with an Optech 12-bit full waveform digitizer were mounted consecutively in a twin-engine Piper PA- 31-350 Navajo Chieftain (Tail Number N154WW).",

The dataset contains 1 m Digital Surface Models (first-stop), Digital Terrain Models (bare-earth), and 10 points/m<sup>2<\/sup> LAS-formated point cloud tiles. The DSMs and DTMs are available in GeoTIFF format with associated shaded relief models. The Digital Terrain Model (DTM) is a ground-surface elevation dataset better suited for derived layers such as slope angle, aspect, and contours. Accessory layers consist of index map layers for point cloud tiles, DEM extent, and flight lines. Other LiDAR DSMs, DTMs, and point cloud data available in this series include <a href=\"http://opentopo.sdsc.edu/lidarDataset?opentopoID=OTLAS.032012.26913.1\">snow-off data<\/a> for 2010. Together, the LiDAR Digital Elevation Models (DEM) and point cloud data will be of interest to land managers, scientists, and others for study of topography, snow, ecosystems and environmental change. The Boulder Creek CZO will be using the LiDAR data to further their mission of focusing on how water, atmosphere, ecosystems, & soils interact and shape the Earth's surface. The \"Critical Zone\" lies between rock and sky. It is essential to life - including human food production - and helps drive Earth's carbon cycle, climate change, stream runoff, and water quality.<br><br>Read the <a href=\"https://cloud.sdsc.edu/v1/AUTH_opentopography/www/metadata/CO10_SnowOn_Metadata_Reports.zip\">FGDC-compliant metadata files<\/a> that are available for each dataset (in .html, .txt, and .xml formats). These files provide numerous details that may be of interest. Also included are flight lines, survey reports, reference materials, and DEM extent shapefiles.<br><br>IMPORTANT NOTE: Due to weather and equipment failures the snow-on surveys were flown during 2 different time periods in May, between which there were substantial snow accumulations.

The dataset contains 1 m Digital Surface Models (first-stop), Digital Terrain Models (bare-earth), and 10 points/m<sup>2<\/sup> LAS-formated point cloud tiles. The DSMs and DTMs are available in GeoTIFF format with associated shaded relief models. The Digital Terrain Model (DTM) is a ground-surface elevation dataset better suited for derived layers such as slope angle, aspect, and contours. Accessory layers consist of index map layers for point cloud tiles, DEM extent, and flight lines. Other LiDAR DSMs, DTMs, and point cloud data available in this series include <a href=\"http://opentopo.sdsc.edu/lidarDataset?opentopoID=OTLAS.032012.26913.1\">snow-off data<\/a> for 2010. Together, the LiDAR Digital Elevation Models (DEM) and point cloud data will be of interest to land managers, scientists, and others for study of topography, snow, ecosystems and environmental change. The Boulder Creek CZO will be using the LiDAR data to further their mission of focusing on how water, atmosphere, ecosystems, & soils interact and shape the Earth's surface. The \"Critical Zone\" lies between rock and sky. It is essential to life - including human food production - and helps drive Earth's carbon cycle, climate change, stream runoff, and water quality.<br><br>Read the <a href=\"https://cloud.sdsc.edu/v1/AUTH_opentopography/www/metadata/CO10_SnowOn_Metadata_Reports.zip\">FGDC-compliant metadata files<\/a> that are available for each dataset (in .html, .txt, and .xml formats).

        "description": "Collaborative Research: Towards an Understanding of the Collective Behavior of Regional Fault Networks: The Marlborough Fault System, New Zealand (James F. Dolan, PI, University of Southern California). This project was a collaborative effort between PI Dolan (USC) and co-I Ed Rhodes (UCLA) and New Zealand collaborators Russ Van Dissen and Rob Langridge of GNS Science.    The survey area consists of a total of 254 km of fault-parallel, predominantly ~1.2-km-wide swaths along parts of the four main right-lateral strike-slip faults that comprise the Marlborough Fault System, in the northwestern portion of New Zealand's South Island. The five fault segments surveyed include sections of the eastern and western parts of the Clarence fault, the central part of the Awatere fault, the central part of the Wairau fault, and part of the eastern (Conway) segment of the Hope fault. These lidar data facilitated detailed analysis of fault offsets along the four main MFS faults, as well as mapping of small displacements that have occurred in recent earthquakes on Marlborough faults in unprecedented detail, the geomorphic development and evolution of fluvial terraces crossing these faults, and the progressive geomorphic manifestation of off-fault deformation with increasing fault displacement. The data were analyzed by the PIs, our New Zealand collaborators, and three graduate students at USC (Robert Zinke, Alexandra Hatem, and Jessica Grenader), and one graduate student at UCLA (Chris McGuire [supervised by Co-I Ed Rhodes]); their results will form major parts of their graduate theses. The lidar data were collected by U.S. National Center for Airborne Laser Mapping (NCALM) personnel using an aircraft and flight personnel subcontracted from New Zealand Aerial Mapping. The data were collected with a combination of NCALM's Optech GEMINI sensor (operated at a laser pulse frequency of 125 kHz in multi-pulse mode, at a nominal height above ground of 1400 m) and NZAM's  Optech 3100A sensor (operated at a laser pulse frequency of 70-100 kHz at various heights depending on terrain). Shot density is &ge; 12 shots/m<sup>2<\/sup>.  The lidar data were utilized in our studies of the incremental slip-rate record of the four main Marlborough faults. The lidar data also provided a means of mapping small displacements that have occurred in recent earthquakes on Marlborough faults in unprecedented detail, the sedimentological development and geomorphic evolution of fluvial terraces crossing these faults, and the progressive geomorphic manifestation of off-fault deformation with increasing fault displacement (see Zinke et al., 2015 Geology for a discussion of this latter topic [doi:10.1130/G37065.1]).",

AOP surveyed three NEON terrestrial sites and one aquatic site located in central California, extending over a large elevation/climate gradient from the southern foothills to the mixed conifer forest zone of the Sierra Nevada. These sites cover diverse ecological sub-regions ranging from open woodland dominated by oaks and foothill pine at the San Joaquin Experiment Range core site (SJER), mixed conifer/deciduous forest at the Soaproot Saddle relocatable site (SOAP) and Providence Creek aquatic site (PROV), and red fir forest at the Teakettle relocatable site (TEAK).

The dataset contains 1 m Digital Surface Models (first-stop), Digital Terrain Models (bare-earth), and 10 points/m<sup>2<\/sup> LAS-formated point cloud tiles. The DSMs and DTMs are available in GeoTIFF format with associated shaded relief models. The Digital Terrain Model (DTM) is a ground-surface elevation dataset better suited for derived layers such as slope angle, aspect, and contours. Accessory layers consist of index map layers for point cloud tiles, DEM extent, and flight lines. Other LiDAR DSMs, DTMs, and point cloud data available in this series include <a href=\"http://opentopo.sdsc.edu/lidarDataset?opentopoID=OTLAS.032012.26913.1\">snow-off data<\/a> for 2010. Together, the LiDAR Digital Elevation Models (DEM) and point cloud data will be of interest to land managers, scientists, and others for study of topography, snow, ecosystems and environmental change. The Boulder Creek CZO will be using the LiDAR data to further their mission of focusing on how water, atmosphere, ecosystems, & soils interact and shape the Earth's surface. The \"Critical Zone\" lies between rock and sky. It is essential to life - including human food production - and helps drive Earth's carbon cycle, climate change, stream runoff, and water quality.<br><br>Read the <a href=\"https://cloud.sdsc.edu/v1/AUTH_opentopography/www/metadata/CO10_SnowOn_Metadata_Reports.zip\">FGDC-compliant metadata files<\/a> that are available for each dataset (in .html, .txt, and .xml formats).

        "description": "Collaborative Research: Towards an Understanding of the Collective Behavior of Regional Fault Networks: The Marlborough Fault System, New Zealand (James F. Dolan, PI, University of Southern California). This project was a collaborative effort between PI Dolan (USC) and co-I Ed Rhodes (UCLA) and New Zealand collaborators Russ Van Dissen and Rob Langridge of GNS Science.    The survey area consists of a total of 254 km of fault-parallel, predominantly ~1.2-km-wide swaths along parts of the four main right-lateral strike-slip faults that comprise the Marlborough Fault System, in the northwestern portion of New Zealand's South Island. The five fault segments surveyed include sections of the eastern and western parts of the Clarence fault, the central part of the Awatere fault, the central part of the Wairau fault, and part of the eastern (Conway) segment of the Hope fault. These lidar data facilitated detailed analysis of fault offsets along the four main MFS faults, as well as mapping of small displacements that have occurred in recent earthquakes on Marlborough faults in unprecedented detail, the geomorphic development and evolution of fluvial terraces crossing these faults, and the progressive geomorphic manifestation of off-fault deformation with increasing fault displacement. The data were analyzed by the PIs, our New Zealand collaborators, and three graduate students at USC (Robert Zinke, Alexandra Hatem, and Jessica Grenader), and one graduate student at UCLA (Chris McGuire [supervised by Co-I Ed Rhodes]); their results will form major parts of their graduate theses. The lidar data were collected by U.S. National Center for Airborne Laser Mapping (NCALM) personnel using an aircraft and flight personnel subcontracted from New Zealand Aerial Mapping. The data were collected with a combination of NCALM's Optech GEMINI sensor (operated at a laser pulse frequency of 125 kHz in multi-pulse mode, at a nominal height above ground of 1400 m) and NZAM's  Optech 3100A sensor (operated at a laser pulse frequency of 70-100 kHz at various heights depending on terrain). Shot density is &ge; 12 shots/m<sup>2<\/sup>.  The lidar data were utilized in our studies of the incremental slip-rate record of the four main Marlborough faults. The lidar data also provided a means of mapping small displacements that have occurred in recent earthquakes on Marlborough faults in unprecedented detail, the sedimentological development and geomorphic evolution of fluvial terraces crossing these faults, and the progressive geomorphic manifestation of off-fault deformation with increasing fault displacement (see Zinke et al., 2015 Geology for a discussion of this latter topic [doi:10.1130/G37065.1]).",

The dataset contains 1 m Digital Surface Models (first-stop), Digital Terrain Models (bare-earth), and 10 points/m<sup>2<\/sup> LAS-formated point cloud tiles. The DSMs and DTMs are available in GeoTIFF format with associated shaded relief models. The Digital Terrain Model (DTM) is a ground-surface elevation dataset better suited for derived layers such as slope angle, aspect, and contours. Accessory layers consist of index map layers for point cloud tiles, DEM extent, and flight lines. Other LiDAR DSMs, DTMs, and point cloud data available in this series include <a href=\"http://opentopo.sdsc.edu/lidarDataset?opentopoID=OTLAS.032012.26913.1\">snow-off data<\/a> for 2010. Together, the LiDAR Digital Elevation Models (DEM) and point cloud data will be of interest to land managers, scientists, and others for study of topography, snow, ecosystems and environmental change. The Boulder Creek CZO will be using the LiDAR data to further their mission of focusing on how water, atmosphere, ecosystems, & soils interact and shape the Earth's surface. The \"Critical Zone\" lies between rock and sky. It is essential to life - including human food production - and helps drive Earth's carbon cycle, climate change, stream runoff, and water quality.<br><br>Read the <a href=\"https://cloud.sdsc.edu/v1/AUTH_opentopography/www/metadata/CO10_SnowOn_Metadata_Reports.zip\">FGDC-compliant metadata files<\/a> that are available for each dataset (in .html, .txt, and .xml formats). These files provide numerous details that may be of interest. Also included are flight lines, survey reports, reference materials, and DEM extent shapefiles.<br><br>IMPORTANT NOTE: Due to weather and equipment failures the snow-on surveys were flown during 2 different time periods in May, between which there were substantial snow accumulations. Do not combine data from May 5/9, 2010 and May 20/21, 2010.",

Surprise Valley is a seismically active geothermal area in the northwestern Basin and Range. Data were collected to create a high-resolution topographic base for correlation with an airborne magnetic survey (Glen), as well as to map and assess offset along Quaternary fault scarps (Egger). The survey took place in June of 2012. The DEM derived from the data has a resolution of 1 point per 0.5 m<sup>2<\/sup>.

The original Seed project requested survey area of 40 km<sup>2<\/sup> was defined by two irregular polygons located along the Harper Lake Fault in the areas adjacent Gravel and Waterman Hills. Additional funding was secured to add two additional areas also located along the faults and between the original two polygons. The combined area of all the four polygons totaled 75.875 km<sup>2<\/sup>. The final data collection has an area of 246 km<sup>2<\/sup> The Harper lake fault is aligned between the towns of Barstow and Ridgecrest, California. Two flights were required to collect the data. Both flights took place on Sunday June 17, 2012. It was collected on a Sunday because part of the survey area are underneath Restricted airspace controlled by the Edwards Air Force Base and access    to it is preferably granted on Sundays. Also due to airspace restrictions the flying height above average ground was 900m rather than the preferred 600m. The plan consisted of 16 project lines running NW-SE along the fault center line.",

Data were provided by the University of Maryland and the <a href=\"http://sonomavegmap.org\">Sonoma County Vegetation Mapping and Lidar Program<\/a> under grant NNX13AP69G from NASA's Carbon Monitoring System (Dr. Ralph Dubayah, PI). The Sonoma County Vegetation Mapping and Lidar Program is NASA/UMD's local partner in this project- its members are as follows:  the Sonoma County Agricultural Preservation and Open Space District, the Sonoma County Water Agency, the California Department of Fish and Wildlife, the United States Geological Survey, the Sonoma County Information Systems Department, the Sonoma County Transportation and Public Works Department, the Nature Conservancy, and the City of Petaluma.<\/p><p>These data will be used for various research projects throughout Sonoma County. They are critical to assessing climate mitigation and adaptation strategies and benefits provided by the landscape, such as the amount of carbon sequestration in forests or the degree to which riparian areas, floodplains, and coastal habitats may buffer extreme weather events. Other research applications include groundwater, ecosystem services valuation, ecosystem resiliency, and wildlife habitat connectivity. Finally, these data sets are key to facilitating good planning and management for watershed protection, flood control, fire and fuels management and wildlife habitat conservation.<\/p><p>The data was collected between September 28 and November 26, 2013 by Watershed Sciences, Inc. (WSI). Lidar was collected at high density greater than 8 pulses per square meter. WSI used two airplanes, one carrying a Leica ALS50 and the other a Leica ALS70; systems were flown at 900 meters above ground level, capturing a scan angle of 15 degrees from nadir (30 degree field of view). 4-band, 6-inch resolution aerial photography was collected simultaneously with the Lidar data.<\/p>",

Pioneer woody riparian seedlings recruit on river bars and alter hydraulics and sediment transport, thus changing bar morphology. Explanations of barform morphodynamics have emphasized the role of bar-induced convective accelerations, steering of the flow, and resulting effects on sediment. The influence of vegetation on bar evolution, however, has not been integrated into our current understanding of barform morphodynamics. This ALSM dataset was collected via an NCALM Seed Grant to quantify how vegetation (cottonwood and tamarisk) changes barform morphology, and how vegetation and related topography collectively influences barform morphodynamics. This research has implications for understanding how vegetation influences channel form.",

Data were provided by the University of Maryland and the <a href=\"http://sonomavegmap.org\">Sonoma County Vegetation Mapping and Lidar Program<\/a> under grant NNX13AP69G from NASA's Carbon Monitoring System (Dr. Ralph Dubayah, PI). The Sonoma County Vegetation Mapping and Lidar Program is NASA/UMD's local partner in this project- its members are as follows:  the Sonoma County Agricultural Preservation and Open Space District, the Sonoma County Water Agency, the California Department of Fish and Wildlife, the United States Geological Survey, the Sonoma County Information Systems Department, the Sonoma County Transportation and Public Works Department, the Nature Conservancy, and the City of Petaluma.<\/p><p>These data will be used for various research projects throughout Sonoma County. They are critical to assessing climate mitigation and adaptation strategies and benefits provided by the landscape, such as the amount of carbon sequestration in forests or the degree to which riparian areas, floodplains, and coastal habitats may buffer extreme weather events. Other research applications include groundwater, ecosystem services valuation, ecosystem resiliency, and wildlife habitat connectivity. Finally, these data sets are key to facilitating good planning and management for watershed protection, flood control, fire and fuels management and wildlife habitat conservation.<\/p><p>The data was collected between September 28 and November 26, 2013 by Watershed Sciences, Inc. (WSI). Lidar was collected at high density greater than 8 pulses per square meter. WSI used two airplanes, one carrying a Leica ALS50 and the other a Leica ALS70; systems were flown at 900 meters above ground level, capturing a scan angle of 15 degrees from nadir (30 degree field of view). 4-band, 6-inch resolution aerial photography was collected simultaneously with the Lidar data.<\/p>",

The requested survey area consisted of two separate polygons within the boundary of Mount Rainier National Park in Washington on the southwestern flank of the volcano. Their close proximity enabled the two surveys to be flown most efficiently as a single polygon. The eastern polygon (Legg) covers the Kautz Creek watershed and was collected to investigate landscape response to debris flows in order to implicate hazards in Mt. Rainier National Park. The western polygon (Anderson) covers the Tahoma Creek watershed and was collected to assess climatically-driven aggradation in a mountain stream. The total area for the combined survey including the area between the requested polygons and the additional coverage in the northwest corner is approximately 123 square kilometers. The survey required 4 flights which took place from August 28, 2012 - September 1, 2012.",

Unfortunately the ever-present cloud cover on the wet side prevented the completion of the survey. The survey attempts took placed from February 5, 2013 through February 12, 2013.",

The survey area is an 90 square kilometer box located 40 km northeast of Kalispell, Montana This area was flown on May 29, 2005 and completed on May 30, 2005. Lidar data from the Nyack Floodplain on the Middle Fork of the Flathead River was collected for several purposes. The first was to provide a base image from which we could place a network of groundwater wells. The data was also used combination with optical remotes sensing data, both airborne and satellite, to identify pixels within multispectral optical imagery that corresponded to various vegetation height elevations. Those pixels were then separately classified by vegetation type. Data was also used to conduct simple flood inundation modeling of the floodplain and in combination with measures of flow depth and velocity extracting water surface elevation from the lidar to map the spatial distribution of stream power. This area has a repeat survey from Spetember 2005: <a href=\"http://opentopo.sdsc.edu/lidarDataset.jsp?opentopoID=OTLAS.032013.26912.1\"title=Flathead Lake Biological Station, MT (September 2005)\">Flathead Lake Biological Station, MT (September 2005)<\/a>.",

The requested survey area consisted of two separate polygons within the boundary of Mount Rainier National Park in Washington on the southwestern flank of the volcano. Their close proximity enabled the two surveys to be flown most efficiently as a single polygon. The eastern polygon (Legg) covers the Kautz Creek watershed and was collected to investigate landscape response to debris flows in order to implicate hazards in Mt. Rainier National Park. The western polygon (Anderson) covers the Tahoma Creek watershed and was collected to assess climatically-driven aggradation in a mountain stream. The total area for the combined survey including the area between the requested polygons and the additional coverage in the northwest corner is approximately 123 square kilometers. The survey required 4 flights which took place from August 28, 2012 - September 1, 2012.",

The CU Environmental Center is using the lidar data, combined with building footprint vector data from the campus GIS system, to facilitate site selection for new solar arrays. The lidar data and terrain products enables analysis of insolation using the GRASS GIS implementation of the SOLPOS 2.0 (SOLar POSition and intensity) algorithm developed and maintained by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL). This allows campus solar sites to take into account day length, position of the sun, seasonal atmospheric effects, orientation and the local shading effects from trees, buildings and other structures.",

PI: Shane Grigsby, University of Colorado, Boulder. <br>Lidar survey of the CU-Boulder campus as part of a solar energy potential and photovoltaic planning study. The acquisition covers 45 km<sup>2<\/sup> and includes East Campus, West Campus, and South Campus, as well as portions of the Flatirons and surrounding areas in multiple return, classified points. The CU Environmental Center is using the Lidar data, combined with building footprint vector data from the campus GIS system, to facilitate site selection for new solar arrays. The Lidar data and terrain products enables analysis of insolation using the GRASS GIS implementation of the SOLPOS 2.0 (SOLar POSition and intensity) algorithm developed and maintained by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL). This allows campus solar sites to take into account day length, position of the sun, seasonal atmospheric effects, orientation and the local shading effects from trees, buildings and other structures.",

SRTM consisted of a specially modified radar system that flew onboard the Space Shuttle Endeavour during an 11-day mission in February of 2000. SRTM is an international project spearheaded by the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). <\/p>  <b>Version 3<\/b>:  Elimination of the voids in the NASA SRTM DEM was the primary goal of a project under the NASA MEaSUREs (Making Earth System Data Records for Use in Research Environments) Program.  Ultimately this was achieved by filling the voids with elevation data primarily from the ASTER GDEM2 (Global Digital Elevation Model Version 2) and secondarily from the USGS GMTED2010 elevation model or the USGS National Elevation Dataset (NED). NASA SRTM V3.0 three-arc-second data are provided in two forms: (1) by three-by-three averaging of the one arc-second samples, and (2) by extracting the middle sample of those same three-by-three samples.

This is a non-standard version of the SRTM dataset that is often used for InSAR analysis. This dataset was converted from the orthometric version using the EGM96 geoid model available <a href=\"http://download.osgeo.org/proj/vdatum/egm96_15/\">here<\/a>. For additional conversion details feel free to <a href=\"http://www.opentopography.org/contact\">contact us<\/a>.<\/h3><br> <br> <p>The <a href=\"http://www2.jpl.nasa.gov/srtm/\"title=\"Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM)\">Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM)<\/a> obtained elevation data on a near-global scale to generate the most complete high-resolution digital topographic database of Earth. SRTM consisted of a specially modified radar system that flew onboard the Space Shuttle Endeavour during an 11-day mission in February of 2000. SRTM is an international project spearheaded by the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). <\/p>  <b>Version 3<\/b>:  Elimination of the voids in the NASA SRTM DEM was the primary goal of a project under the NASA MEaSUREs (Making Earth System Data Records for Use in Research Environments) Program.  Ultimately this was achieved by filling the voids with elevation data primarily from the ASTER GDEM2 (Global Digital Elevation Model Version 2) and secondarily from the USGS GMTED2010 elevation model or the USGS National Elevation Dataset (NED). NASA SRTM V3.0 three-arc-second data are provided in two forms: (1) by three-by-three averaging of the one arc-second samples, and (2) by extracting the middle sample of those same three-by-three samples.

This Lidar survey was conducted over the North Carolina Outer Banks between Cape Lookout and Manteo on June 22, 2006 (GPS Day 173). The survey window needed to be optimized for both a low PDOP (strong satellite geometry) and low tide, with low tide being more essential. Both of these objectives were successfully met as best as possible. Low tide at Cape Hatteras on June 22 (06/22/2006) was 11:02AM LDT and was predicted at -0.2 L. Our survey time was from 10:10 AM - 1:30 PM which included degraded PDOP from 12:15 - 12:45, but was otherwise good.<\/p>  <p>Three flight passes were required to cover the coastline. The coastline was flown by eye since navigation waypoints for this project were not provided. Data available through OpenTopography were collected at a \"low pass\" height (600 meters). This area was re-surveyed in July 2007 and data are available through OpenTopography: <a href=\" http://www.opentopography.org/id/OTLAS.032013.26918.2\"> North Carolina Coast: Quantifying Patterns of Coastal Change (July 2007)<\/a><\/p>",

        "description": "<p>The Diablo Canyon Power Plant (DCPP) Lidar and Imagery datasets are comprised of three separate Lidar surveys: Diablo Canyon (2010), Los Osos (2011), and San Simeon (2013).<\/p>    <p>The Diablo Canyon project study is located in San Luis Obispo County, California, and encompasses approximately 10,634 acres (43.03 square kilometers). Watershed Sciences, Inc. (WSI) collected Light Detection and Ranging (Lidar) data on both the inland and intertidal land within the Diablo Canyon study area on 28 January 2010. For optimal capture of the intertidal zone, WSI acquired Lidar data of the coastline during seasonal low tides (between 0.0 ft and peak low of ~ -1.5 ft) and in conjunction with a PDOP value of less than 3.0.<\/p>    <p>This Lidar survey utilized a Leica ALS50 Phase II laser system. The sensor scan angle was &#177;13&#176; from nadir with a pulse rate designed to yield an average native density of &#8805;8 pulses per square meter over terrestrial surfaces. The area of interest was surveyed with an opposing flight line side-lap of &#8805;50% (&#8805;100% overlap) to reduce laser shadowing and increase surface laser painting.<\/p>   <p>This survey was flown as part of the DCPP Long-Term Seismic Program (LTSP). In addition to aerial Lidar data, DEM and orthophotography raster data are available for this area: <a href=\"http://www.opentopography.org/id/OTSDEM.022013.26910.2\" title=\"Diablo Canyon DEMs and Orthophotos\">Diablo Canyon DEMs and Orthophotos<\/a>.<\/p>",

Watershed Sciences, Inc. (WSI) collected Light Detection and Ranging (Lidar) data and orthophotography across the DCPP San Simeon survey area from 29 January 2013 to 25 February 2013. For optimal capture of the intertidal zone, WSI acquired Lidar data of the coastline during seasonal low tides between 7 February 2013 and 10 February 2013.<\/p>    <p>The lidar survey utilized a Leica ALS70 sensor in a Cessna Caravan, and an Optech Orion sensor in a Bell Long Ranger. The Leica system was used for acquisition of the inland portion of the study area. It was set to acquire 240,000 laser pulses per second (i.e., 240 kHz pulse rate) and flown at 1,100 meters above ground level (AGL), capturing a scan angle of &#177;15&#176; from nadir. The Orion system was used to acquire the intertidal portion of the study area. It was set to acquire 175,000 laser pulses per second and flown at 300 meters AGL, capturing a scan angle of &#177;13&#176; from nadir. Both laser systems were programmed to yield an average native pulse density of  &#8805;8 pulses per square meter over terrestrial surfaces. <\/p>   <p>Digital orthophotos were collected using a 260 megapixel ultra large format digital aerial camera. Image radiometric values were calibrated to specific gain and exposure settings associated with each capture using Microsoft's UltraMap software suite. The calibrated images were saved in TIFF format for input to subsequent processes. Photo position and orientation were calculated by linking the time of image capture, the corresponding aircraft position and attitude, and the smoothed best estimate of trajectory (SBET) data in POSPAC. Within the Inpho software suite, automated aerial triangulation was performed to tie images together and to align with ground control. The orthophotos were delivered in 0.375 USGS tiles with a 3'' pixel resolution.<\/p>  <p>This survey was flown in conjunction with the DCPP Senior Seismic Hazard Analysis Committee (SSHAC) Level 3 process and as part of the DCPP Long-Term Seismic Program (LTSP).

        "description": "<p>The Diablo Canyon Power Plant (DCPP) Lidar and Imagery datasets are comprised of three separate Lidar surveys: Diablo Canyon (2010), Los Osos (2011), and San Simeon (2013).<\/p>    <p>The Diablo Canyon project study is located in San Luis Obispo County, California, and encompasses approximately 10,634 acres (43.03 square kilometers). Watershed Sciences, Inc. (WSI) collected Light Detection and Ranging (Lidar) data on both the inland and intertidal land within the Diablo Canyon study area on 28 January 2010. For optimal capture of the intertidal zone, WSI acquired Lidar data of the coastline during seasonal low tides (between 0.0 ft and peak low of ~ -1.5 ft) and in conjunction with a PDOP value of less than 3.0.<\/p>    <p>This Lidar survey utilized a Leica ALS50 Phase II laser system. The sensor scan angle was &#177;13&#176; from nadir with a pulse rate designed to yield an average native density of &#8805;8 pulses per square meter over terrestrial surfaces. The area of interest was surveyed with an opposing flight line side-lap of &#8805;50% (&#8805;100% overlap) to reduce laser shadowing and increase surface laser painting.<\/p>   <p>This survey was flown as part of the DCPP Long-Term Seismic Program (LTSP). In addition to raster data, Lidar point cloud data are available for this area: <a href=\"http://www.opentopography.org/id/OTLAS.022013.26910.2\" title=\"Diablo Canyon Point Cloud data\">Diablo Canyon Point Cloud Data<\/a>.<\/p>",

The eastern polygon over the Sullivan Anticline is located about 140 miles southeast of Cordova, AK. The Sullivan Anticline was surveyed with 5 flights over a period of 8 days from September 3, 2005 through September 10, 2005.

        "description": "<p>The Diablo Canyon Power Plant (DCPP) Lidar and Imagery datasets are comprised of three separate Lidar surveys: Diablo Canyon (2010), Los Osos (2011), and San Simeon (2013).<\/p>      <p>The DCPP Los Osos project study area is located in San Luis Obispo County, California, and encompasses approximately 170,000 acres (674.59 square kilometers). Watershed Sciences, Inc. (WSI) collected Light Detection and Ranging (Lidar) data across the project area from 17 March 2011 to 31 March 2011.<\/p>      <p>The lidar survey utilized a Leica ALS60 sensor in a Cessna Caravan. The Leica system was set to acquire 105,900 laser pulses per second (i.e., 105.9 kHz pulse rate) and flown at 900 meters above ground level (AGL), capturing a scan angle of &#177;14&#176 from nadir when clouds and terrain permitted. With these flight parameters, the laser swath width is 449m and the laser pulse footprint is 21cm. These settings yield an average native pulse density of &#8805;8 pulses per square meter over terrestrial surfaces.  <p>This survey was flown as part of the DCPP Long-Term Seismic Program (LTSP). In addition to aerial Lidar data, DEM raster data are available for this area: <a href=\"http://www.opentopography.org/id/OTSDEM.022013.26910.3\" title=\"Los Osos DEMs\">Los Osos  DEMs<\/a>.<\/p>",

        "description": "<p>The Diablo Canyon Power Plant (DCPP) Lidar and Imagery datasets are comprised of three separate Lidar surveys: Diablo Canyon (2010), Los Osos (2011), and San Simeon (2013).<\/p>    <p>The DCPP San Simeon project study area is located primarily in San Luis Obispo County, California, encompasses approximately 195,000 acres (801 km<sup>2<\/sup>), and measures 75 miles in length.  Watershed Sciences, Inc. (WSI) collected Light Detection and Ranging (Lidar) data and orthophotography across the DCPP San Simeon survey area from 29 January 2013 to 25 February 2013. For optimal capture of the intertidal zone, WSI acquired Lidar data of the coastline during seasonal low tides between 7 February 2013 and 10 February 2013.<\/p>    <p>The lidar survey utilized a Leica ALS70 sensor in a Cessna Caravan, and an Optech Orion sensor in a Bell Long Ranger. The Leica system was used for acquisition of the inland portion of the study area. It was set to acquire 240,000 laser pulses per second (i.e., 240 kHz pulse rate) and flown at 1,100 meters above ground level (AGL), capturing a scan angle of &#177;15&#176; from nadir. The Orion system was used to acquire the intertidal portion of the study area. It was set to acquire 175,000 laser pulses per second and flown at 300 meters AGL, capturing a scan angle of &#177;13&#176; from nadir. Both laser systems were programmed to yield an average native pulse density of  &#8805;8 pulses per square meter over terrestrial surfaces. <\/p>   <p>Digital orthophotos were collected using a 260 megapixel ultra large format digital aerial camera. Image radiometric values were calibrated to specific gain and exposure settings associated with each capture using Microsoft's UltraMap software suite. The calibrated images were saved in TIFF format for input to subsequent processes. Photo position and orientation were calculated by linking the time of image capture, the corresponding aircraft position and attitude, and the smoothed best estimate of trajectory (SBET) data in POSPAC. Within the Inpho software suite, automated aerial triangulation was performed to tie images together and to align with ground control. The orthophotos were delivered in 0.375 USGS tiles with a 3'' pixel resolution.<\/p>   <p>This survey was flown in conjunction with the DCPP Senior Seismic Hazard Analysis Committee (SSHAC) Level 3 process and as part of the DCPP Long-Term Seismic Program (LTSP). In addition to aerial Lidar data, DEM and orthophotography raster data are available for this area: <a href=\"http://www.opentopography.org/id/OTSDEM.032013.26910.2\" title=\"San Simeon DEMs and Orthophotos\">San Simeon DEMs and Orthophotos<\/a>.<\/p>",

        "description": "<p>The Diablo Canyon Power Plant (DCPP) Lidar and Imagery datasets are comprised of three separate Lidar surveys: Diablo Canyon (2010), Los Osos (2011), and San Simeon (2013).<\/p>      <p>The DCPP Los Osos project study area is located in San Luis Obispo County, California, and encompasses approximately 170,000 acres (674.59 square kilometers). Watershed Sciences, Inc. (WSI) collected Light Detection and Ranging (Lidar) data across the project area from 17 March 2011 to 31 March 2011.<\/p>      <p>The lidar survey utilized a Leica ALS60 sensor in a Cessna Caravan. The Leica system was set to acquire 105,900 laser pulses per second (i.e., 105.9 kHz pulse rate) and flown at 900 meters above ground level (AGL), capturing a scan angle of &#177;14&#176 from nadir when clouds and terrain permitted. With these flight parameters, the laser swath width is 449m and the laser pulse footprint is 21cm. These settings yield an average native pulse density of &#8805;8 pulses per square meter over terrestrial surfaces.<\/p>  <p>This survey was flown as part of the DCPP Long-Term Seismic Program (LTSP). In addition to raster data, Lidar point cloud data are available for this area: <a href=\"http://www.opentopography.org/id/OTLAS.022013.26910.3\" title=\"Los Osos Point Cloud Data\">Los Osos  Point Cloud Data<\/a>.<\/p>",

        "description": "NCALM Project. PI: Mark Lorang, The University of Montana- Missoula. The survey area is an 90 square kilometer box located 40 km northeast of Kalispell, Montana This area was flown on September 14, 2005 and completed on September 15, 2005. Lidar data from the Nyack Floodplain on the Middle Fork of the Flathead River was collected for several purposes. The first was to provide a base image from which we could place a network of groundwater wells. The data was also used combination with optical remotes sensing data, both airborne and satellite, to identify pixels within multispectral optical imagery that corresponded to various vegetation height elevations. Those pixels were then separately classified by vegetation type. Data was also used to conduct simple flood inundation modeling of the floodplain and in combination with measures of flow depth and velocity extracting water surface elevation from the lidar to map the spatial distribution of stream power. This area has a repeat survey from May 2005: <a href=\"http://opentopo.sdsc.edu/lidarDataset.jsp?opentopoID=OTLAS.052013.26912.2\"title=Flathead Lake Biological Station, MT (May 2005)\">Flathead Lake Biological Station, MT (May 2005)<\/a>.",

        "description": "These airborne lidar data were gathered by the <a href=\"http://www.inegi.org.mx/\" title=\"Instituto Nacional de Estadistica y Geografia \">Instituto Nacional de Estadistica y Geografia<\/a> of Mexico as part of a regional mapping activity in northwestern Mexico. They span the area that ruptured in the <a href=\"http://www.opentopography.org/id/OTLAS.122010.32611.1\" title=\"April 2010 M7.2 El Mayor Cucupah earthquake\" >April 2010 M7.2 El Mayor Cucupah earthquake<\/a> which was laser scanned and for which data are available in OpenTopography's holdings. Alejandro Hinojosa of CICESE is the contact person for these data. This version of the data has been empirically corrected by Craig Glennie and colleagues at the University of Houston. Details for the data corrections as follows: <br> <br> Rather than trying to correct the whole dataset, we just concentrated on the portion that overlaps with the post-event data. Here is a brief summary of what we did:<br> <div style=\"margin-left: 1em;\"><p><b>(1)<\/b> Pre-Event Data was given in  ITRF 1992 (1988.0 epoch) and post-event NCALM data was processed in ITRF2000 (Epoch 2010.627).  NGS software package HTDP was used to compute a coordinate shift between these two reference frames (-0.900 m East, 0.429 m North, 0.004 m Up). To correct the 2006 data to the same datum as the NCALM data, we added the vector (-0.900,0.429,0.004) to all of the pre-event data points.<\/p>   <p><\/div> <div style=\"margin-left: 1em;\"><b>(2)<\/b> Original dataset contained all scan data out to +/- 28 degree scan angle.  There are significant problems at the outer edge of the scan, so all scan lines were cropped to +/-24 degrees.  This results in minimal overlap between scan lines, but doesn't create any data gaps between flight lines.<\/p> <\/div>  <div style=\"margin-left: 1em;\"><p><b>(3)<\/b>Dataset was then re-boresighted.  We determined a roll and pitch offset for each flight line individually, plus a global mirror scale factor.<\/p><\/div> <div style=\"margin-left: 1em;\"><p><b>(4)<\/b> Finally, we determined an individual delta \"z\" correction for each flightline. Note that for all of the above adjustments, none of the post-earthquake data was used.  We purposely sequestered the two datasets so as not to inadvertently remove differences caused  by the earthquake. To give an idea of the magnitude of the improvement, on the pre-event dataset (as delivered to me) in the overlap, we were seeing average elevation differences of 95 cm (1 sigma).<\/p> <\/div> After cropping the data to 24 degrees, the average elevation differences were 70 cm (1 sigma) After steps (3) and (4) above, the average elevation differences were reduced to 52 cm (1 sigma).  So overall, it appears we were able to reduce the vertical errors by almost a factor of two.",

        "description": "NCALM. PI: Brian Wernicke, Caltech and Bernard Guest, University of Calgary. The survey area consisted of three 500 meter wide corridors near the California-Nevada border and across the Pahrump Valley. The corridors total approximately 60 km long, 0.5 to 1 km wide and contained approximately 40 square km. Please note that the flight was conducted in an unconventional way as this was an add-on to other work and was done to quickly obtain data for the requested area. Rather than flying a regular, straight grid across the area, the airplane banked along the determined trajectory. This way of gathering data introduces noticeable error, especially on the fringes of the flight path, giving a \"corduroy\" appearance to the data. This is in addition to the background periodic fine scale elevation variation (normally 5 to 20cm) which is a property of the Optech LIDAR system, and within the machine's error limits. This effect is less noticeable in Corridor 1 as the plane was following a mostly straight trajectory. Our understanding is that if these preliminary data looked promising, a carefully planned survey would then be conducted if funding became available. Bare-earth extraction was not performed on this dataset due to the scarceness of vegetation in the interest area. Filtering the data with a conservative feature preserving algorithm (Hagerud) can remove some of the vegetation but with the expense of smoothing out some of the morphology in steep areas.",

        "description": "The New Madrid Seismic Zone (NMSZ) has been responsible for producing some of the largest intraplate earthquakes on record (Tuttle et al., 2002). Paleoseismologic studies of sand blows and the Reelfoot fault show that earthquakes occurred in the last 4000 years at intervals of approximately 400-600 years (Kelson et al., 1995; Tuttle et al., 2002; Holbrook et al., 2006). The 1811-1812 NMSZ sequence produced three major earthquakes (M 7-8) followed by several large aftershocks and hundreds of smaller ones, resulting in a felt area that reached the east coast of the United States and caused destruction of several settlements along the Mississippi River due to liquefaction and strong shaking (Nuttli 1973, Johnston and Schweig, 1996). The risk of another large destructive earthquake in this region is of great concern to the USGS and local and federal authorities because several large metropolitan areas (Memphis, Little Rock, Nashville, St. Louis), and hundreds of smaller communities lie in or near the NMSZ.<br><br>The mechanism for occurrence of earthquakes in the NMSZ is widely debated. Studies reveal the NMSZ is underlain by a failed rifting event, dating from late Precambrian. During the failed rifting event, emplacement of mafic plutons throughout the crustal column took place. Further studies show a correlation between the rift and current seismic activity. This correlation suggests that the source of the earthquakes was from slippage along weak zones within the failed rift caused by the E-W compressive stress of the region, a result of plate motion. Seismic monitoring shows that there is a spatial correlation of the active seismic zone with the failed Reelfoot Rift.",

Terrain surveyed include coverage of the surface projection of the Commerce Geophysical lineament, Crowley's Ridge, and features in and near the St. Francis River. Specifications for the acquisition followed recommendations made by R. Haugerud et al. in a proposed specification for lidar surveys in the Pacific Northwest (2008). The data were acquired by the Oregon Department of Geology and Mineral Industries in association with Oregon Lidar Consortium.

New Lidar data was captured except where previously captured Lidar data exists, or the participating County bought-up to a higher resolution of 1.0-meter average post spacing Lidar data.  Existing Lidar data exists for: Porter, Steuben, Noble, De Kalb, Allen, Madison, Delaware, Hendricks, Marion, Hancock, Morgan, Johnson, Shelby, Monroe, and portions of Vermillion, Parke, Vigo, Clay, Sullivan, Knox, Gibson, and Posey.  These existing Lidar datasets were seamlessly integrated into this new statewide dataset.  From this seamless Lidar product a statewide 5-foot post spacing hydro-flattened DEM product was created and is also available.  See the FGDC Metadata provided for more details. <br><br>This statewide project is divided into three geographic areas captured over a 3-year period (2011-2013):<br><b>Area 1 (2011)<\/b> Indiana central counties: St. Joseph, Elkhart, Starke, Marshall, Kosciusko, Pulaski, Fulton, Cass, Miami, Wabash, Carroll, Howard, Clinton, Tipton, Boone, Hendricks, Marion, Morgan, Johnson, Monroe, Brown, Bartholomew, Lawrence, Jackson, Orange, Washington, Crawford, and Harrison. <br><br><b>Area 2 (2012)<\/b> Indiana eastern counties: LaGrange, Steuben, Noble, DeKalb, Whitley, Allen, Huntington, Wells, Adams, Grant, Blackford, Jay, Hamilton, Madison, Delaware, Randolph, Hancock, Henry, Wayne, Shelby, Rush, Fayette, Union, Decatur, Franklin, Jennings, Ripley, Dearborn, Ohio, Scott, Jefferson, Switzerland, Clark, and Floyd. <br><br><b>Area 3 (2013)<\/b> Indiana western counties: Lake, Porter, LaPorte, Newton, Jasper, Benton, White, Warren, Tippecanoe, Fountain, Montgomery, Vermillion, Parke, Putnam, Vigo, Clay, Owen, Sullivan, Greene, Knox, Daviess, Martin, Gibson, Pike, Dubois, Posey, Vanderburgh, Warrick, Spencer, and Perry.<br><br><b>Funders of <a href=\"http://opentopography.org\" title=\"OpenTopography\">OpenTopography<\/a> Hosting of the Indiana Statewide Lidar and DEM data: <\/b><a href=\"http://www.in.nrcs.usda.gov\" title=\"USDA NRCS, Indiana\">USDA NRCS, Indiana<\/a>, <a href=\"http://www.ispls.org\" title=\"ISPLS Foundation\">ISPLS Foundation<\/a>, <a href=\"http://www.in.gov/iot/2398.htm\" title=\"Indiana Geographic Information Office, Indiana Office of Technology\">Indiana Geographic Information Office, Indiana Office of Technology<\/a>, <a href=\"http://igs.indiana.edu\" title=\"Indiana Geological Survey\">Indiana Geological Survey<\/a>, <a href=\"http://www.surdex.com\" title=\"Surdex Corporation\">Surdex Corporation<\/a>, <a href=\"http://www.vectren.com\" title=\"Vectren Energy Delivery, Indiana\">Vectren Energy Delivery, Indiana<\/a>, <a href=\"http://www.woolpert.com\" title=\"Woolpert, Inc.\">Woolpert, Inc.<\/a>, and Individual IGIC Member Donations from Jim Stout, Jeff McCann, Cele Morris, Becky McKinley, Phil Worrall, and Andy Nicholson.",

New Lidar data was captured except where previously captured Lidar data exists, or the participating County bought-up to a higher resolution of 1.0-meter average post spacing Lidar data.  Existing Lidar data exists for: Porter, Steuben, Noble, De Kalb, Allen, Madison, Delaware, Hendricks, Marion, Hancock, Morgan, Johnson, Shelby, Monroe, and portions of Vermillion, Parke, Vigo, Clay, Sullivan, Knox, Gibson, and Posey.  These existing Lidar datasets were seamlessly integrated into this new statewide dataset.  From this seamless Lidar product a statewide 5-foot post spacing hydro-flattened DEM product was created and is also available.  See the FGDC Metadata provided for more details. <br><br>This statewide project is divided into three geographic areas captured over a 3-year period (2011-2013):<br><b>Area 1 (2011)<\/b> Indiana central counties: St. Joseph, Elkhart, Starke, Marshall, Kosciusko, Pulaski, Fulton, Cass, Miami, Wabash, Carroll, Howard, Clinton, Tipton, Boone, Hendricks, Marion, Morgan, Johnson, Monroe, Brown, Bartholomew, Lawrence, Jackson, Orange, Washington, Crawford, and Harrison. <br><br><b>Area 2 (2012)<\/b> Indiana eastern counties: LaGrange, Steuben, Noble, DeKalb, Whitley, Allen, Huntington, Wells, Adams, Grant, Blackford, Jay, Hamilton, Madison, Delaware, Randolph, Hancock, Henry, Wayne, Shelby, Rush, Fayette, Union, Decatur, Franklin, Jennings, Ripley, Dearborn, Ohio, Scott, Jefferson, Switzerland, Clark, and Floyd. <br><br><b>Area 3 (2013)<\/b> Indiana western counties: Lake, Porter, LaPorte, Newton, Jasper, Benton, White, Warren, Tippecanoe, Fountain, Montgomery, Vermillion, Parke, Putnam, Vigo, Clay, Owen, Sullivan, Greene, Knox, Daviess, Martin, Gibson, Pike, Dubois, Posey, Vanderburgh, Warrick, Spencer, and Perry.<br><br><b>Funders of <a href=\"http://opentopography.org\" title=\"OpenTopography\">OpenTopography<\/a> Hosting of the Indiana Statewide Lidar and DEM data: <\/b><a href=\"http://www.in.nrcs.usda.gov\" title=\"USDA NRCS, Indiana\">USDA NRCS, Indiana<\/a>, <a href=\"http://www.ispls.org\" title=\"ISPLS Foundation\">ISPLS Foundation<\/a>, <a href=\"http://www.in.gov/iot/2398.htm\" title=\"Indiana Geographic Information Office, Indiana Office of Technology\">Indiana Geographic Information Office, Indiana Office of Technology<\/a>, <a href=\"http://igs.indiana.edu\" title=\"Indiana Geological Survey\">Indiana Geological Survey<\/a>, <a href=\"http://www.surdex.com\" title=\"Surdex Corporation\">Surdex Corporation<\/a>, <a href=\"http://www.vectren.com\" title=\"Vectren Energy Delivery, Indiana\">Vectren Energy Delivery, Indiana<\/a>, <a href=\"http://www.woolpert.com\" title=\"Woolpert, Inc.\">Woolpert, Inc.<\/a>, and Individual IGIC Member Donations from Jim Stout, Jeff McCann, Cele Morris, Becky McKinley, Phil Worrall, and Andy Nicholson.",

New Lidar data was captured except where previously captured Lidar data exists, or the participating County bought-up to a higher resolution of 1.0-meter average post spacing Lidar data.  Existing Lidar data exists for: Porter, Steuben, Noble, De Kalb, Allen, Madison, Delaware, Hendricks, Marion, Hancock, Morgan, Johnson, Shelby, Monroe, and portions of Vermillion, Parke, Vigo, Clay, Sullivan, Knox, Gibson, and Posey.  These existing Lidar datasets were seamlessly integrated into this new statewide dataset.  From this seamless Lidar product a statewide 5-foot post spacing hydro-flattened DEM product was created and is also available.  See the FGDC Metadata provided for more details. <br><br>This statewide project is divided into three geographic areas captured over a 3-year period (2011-2013):<br><b>Area 1 (2011)<\/b> Indiana central counties: St. Joseph, Elkhart, Starke, Marshall, Kosciusko, Pulaski, Fulton, Cass, Miami, Wabash, Carroll, Howard, Clinton, Tipton, Boone, Hendricks, Marion, Morgan, Johnson, Monroe, Brown, Bartholomew, Lawrence, Jackson, Orange, Washington, Crawford, and Harrison. <br><br><b>Area 2 (2012)<\/b> Indiana eastern counties: LaGrange, Steuben, Noble, DeKalb, Whitley, Allen, Huntington, Wells, Adams, Grant, Blackford, Jay, Hamilton, Madison, Delaware, Randolph, Hancock, Henry, Wayne, Shelby, Rush, Fayette, Union, Decatur, Franklin, Jennings, Ripley, Dearborn, Ohio, Scott, Jefferson, Switzerland, Clark, and Floyd. <br><br><b>Area 3 (2013)<\/b> Indiana western counties: Lake, Porter, LaPorte, Newton, Jasper, Benton, White, Warren, Tippecanoe, Fountain, Montgomery, Vermillion, Parke, Putnam, Vigo, Clay, Owen, Sullivan, Greene, Knox, Daviess, Martin, Gibson, Pike, Dubois, Posey, Vanderburgh, Warrick, Spencer, and Perry.<br><br><b>Funders of <a href=\"http://opentopography.org\" title=\"OpenTopography\">OpenTopography<\/a> Hosting of the Indiana Statewide Lidar and DEM data: <\/b><a href=\"http://www.in.nrcs.usda.gov\" title=\"USDA NRCS, Indiana\">USDA NRCS, Indiana<\/a>, <a href=\"http://www.ispls.org\" title=\"ISPLS Foundation\">ISPLS Foundation<\/a>, <a href=\"http://www.in.gov/iot/2398.htm\" title=\"Indiana Geographic Information Office, Indiana Office of Technology\">Indiana Geographic Information Office, Indiana Office of Technology<\/a>, <a href=\"http://igs.indiana.edu\" title=\"Indiana Geological Survey\">Indiana Geological Survey<\/a>, <a href=\"http://www.surdex.com\" title=\"Surdex Corporation\">Surdex Corporation<\/a>, <a href=\"http://www.vectren.com\" title=\"Vectren Energy Delivery, Indiana\">Vectren Energy Delivery, Indiana<\/a>, <a href=\"http://www.woolpert.com\" title=\"Woolpert, Inc.\">Woolpert, Inc.<\/a>, and Individual IGIC Member Donations from Jim Stout, Jeff McCann, Cele Morris, Becky McKinley, Phil Worrall, and Andy Nicholson.",

This includes all of the islands of San Miguel, Santa Rosa, Anacapa, Santa Barbara, and Santa Cruz. The project totals about 288 square miles (747 square kilometers). Elevation data were delivered in 2,000m x 2,000m tiles with 280 tiles produced. Deliverables include LAS 1.2 files (classified and raw), digital elevation model, digital surface model, control data, and metadata. Full waveform data were also collected over the entire project area.<br><br>Data were collected using a Riegl LMS-Q560 laser scanner flown from a helicopter. Helicopters were also used to establish ground control on all five islands. Personnel from National Park Service and The Natural Conservancy (which owns most of Santa Cruz Island) accompanied the survey team to ensure minimal impact to habitat. To assist with positional accuracy, continuously operating reference stations (CORS) on each island were modified by UNAVCO from a 15 second to a one second sampling rate during the collection period. Nominal single swath point density was three points per square meter (seven points with 50% overlap).",

        "description": "Lidar instrument was flown with a Leica ALS50 Lidar system over the period of September 29 - October 3, 2006. This project is the data acquisition phase of a administrative study being done in collaboration with the Nez Perce National Forest, Grangeville, ID; Forest Service Region 1 Regional Office, Missoula, MT (Forest Inventory and Analysis and Remote Sensing/ Geospatial Team); and Rocky Mountain Research Station - Forest Sciences Lab, Moscow, ID. The primary goal of the study is to provide operational implementation of Lidar technology in support of project level planning. The proposed applications of Lidar in support of planning are: vegetation structural modeling, erosion modeling, fuels, transportation planning, timber system planning, wildlife habitat modeling, and stream quality. The Rocky Mountain Research Station will provide the development of peer-reviewed forest structural metrics and technical support in implementation of Lidar technology. The technical specifications have been defined to specifically support vegetation modeling using Lidar data. The project area consists of two contiguous blocks totaling 42,889 hectares in north central Idaho. The project area consists of moderately variable topographic configurations with diverse vegetation components. Vegetation is variable, transitioning from low elevation shrubland and mixed conifers to upper elevation spruce-fir. Ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) and Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) are the predominant species at lower to mid elevations occupying a fairly xeric setting transitioning to grand fir (Abies grandis) and western red cedar (Thuja plicata) at mid elevations and subalpine fir (Abies lasiocarpa) at the higher elevations.",

        "description": "The lidar survey was conducted by vendor Horizon's, 3600 Jet Drive, Rapid City, South Dakota. Lidar instrument was flown in a Leica ALS40 on July 23, August 11 or September 22, 2003. The data were delivered in ascii format with information on return number, easting, northing, elevation and intensity for each return. The ascii files were converted to las format and classified using the Multiscale Curvature Classification (MCC) method of Evans and Hudak (2007). This project is the data acquisition phase of an administrative study being done by Rocky Mountain Research Station - Forest Sciences Lab, Moscow, ID. The primary goal of the study is to provide operational implementation of Lidar technology in support of project level planning. The proposed applications of Lidar in support of planning are: vegetation structural modeling, erosion modeling, fuels, transportation planning, timber system planning, wildlife habitat modeling, and stream quality. The Rocky Mountain Research Station will provide the development of peer-reviewed forest structural metrics and technical support in implementation of Lidar technology. The technical specifications have been defined to specifically support vegetation modeling using Lidar data. The St. Joe National Forest area consists of one contiguous block totaling ~ 55684 hectares in north central Idaho, between Deary and Clarkia. The project area consists of moderately variable topographic configurations with diverse vegetation components.",

        "description": "The lidar survey was conducted by vendor Earth Eye LLC, 3680 Avalon Park Blvd. The data were delivered in LAS 1.1 format with information on return number, easting, northing, elevation, scan angle, and intensity for each return. This project is the data acquisition phase of a administrative study being done in collaboration with the Nez Perce National Forest, Grangeville, ID; Forest Service Region 1 Regional Office, Missoula, MT (Forest Inventory and Analysis and Remote Sensing/ Geospatial Team); and Rocky Mountain Research Station - Forest Sciences Lab, Moscow, ID. The primary goal of the study is to provide operational implementation of Lidar technology in support of project level planning. The proposed applications of Lidar in support of planning are: vegetation structural modeling, erosion modeling, fuels, transportation planning, timber system planning, wildlife habitat modeling, and stream quality. The Rocky Mountain Research Station will provide the development of peer-reviewed forest structural metrics and technical support in implementation of Lidar technology. The technical specifications have been defined to specifically support vegetation modeling using Lidar data. The project area consists of one contiguous blocks totaling 17, 325 hectares in north central Idaho. The project area consists of moderately variable topographic configurations with diverse vegetation components. Clear Creek is a tributary of the Middle Fork Clearwater River located east of Kooskia, Idaho. Vegetation is variable, transitioning from low elevation shrubland and mixed conifers to upper elevation spruce-fir. Ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) and Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) are the predominant species at lower to mid elevations occupying a fairly xeric setting transitioning to grand fir (Abies grandis) and western red cedar (Thuja plicata) at mid elevations and subalpine fir (Abies lasiocarpa) at the higher elevations.",

        "description": "The lidar survey was conducted by vendor Spencer B. Gross, 13545 NW Science Park dr.,97229, Portland, OR. Lidar instrument Leica ALS40 was flown over the period of 13 and 26 July 2002. The primary goal of the study is to provide operational implementation of Lidar technology in support of project level planning. The proposed applications of Lidar in support of planning are: vegetation structural modeling, erosion modeling, fuels, transportation planning, timber system planning, wildlife habitat modeling, and stream quality. The Rocky Mountain Research Station will provide the development of peer-reviewed forest structural metrics and technical support in implementation of Lidar technology. The technical specifications have been defined to specifically support vegetation modeling using Lidar data. The project area consists of four blocks totaling 24, 729 hectares in Nez Perce Reservation, which is located in central Idaho and is a land of beautiful rivers and steep mountains.<br>The data were delivered in ASCII format with information on easting, northing and elevation for each Lidar pulse. The ascii files were converted to las format and classified using the Multiscale Curvature Classification (MCC) method of <u>Evans and Hudak<\/u> (2007). Evans, J.S., and A.T. Hudak.

The scans were collected along the northern Borrego fault over a period of 4 days beginning 16 April 2010, 12 days following the earthquake. This particular dataset covers a section of the rupture across a raised alluvial fan surface where displacements are relatively concentrated along a single fault, with some localized antithetic normal and reverse slip. Depending on how the data is processed and visualized, cm- to m-scale fault scarps, fault free-face striations, displacements defined by offset geomorphic features and cm-scale alluvial fan textures are all visible. Vegetation classification was performed manually in an immersive 3D virtual reality CAVE. This dataset includes intensity-scaled point-coloring. Surveyors: Peter Gold and Austin Elliott, UC Davis",

This data was collected in collaboration between the <a href=\"http://www.ncalm.org\" target=\"_blank\">National Center for Airborne Laser Mapping (NCALM)<\/a> project and the <a href=\"http://czo.colorado.edu/\" target=\"_blank\">Boulder Creek Critical Zone Observatory (CZO)<\/a>, both funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF). The dataset contains 1 m Digital Surface Models (first-stop), Digital Terrain Models (bare-earth), and 10 points/m<sup>2<\/sup> LAS-formated point cloud tiles. The DSMs and DTMs are available in GeoTIFF format, approx. 1-2 GB each, with associated shaded relief models, for a total of 15 GB of data. The Digital Terrain Model (DTM) is a ground-surface elevation dataset better suited for derived layers such as slope angle, aspect, and contours. Accessory layers consist of index map layers for point cloud tiles, DEM extent, and flight lines. Other LiDAR DSMs, DTMs, and point cloud data available in this series include snow-on data for 2010. Together, the LiDAR Digital Elevation Models (DEM) and point cloud data will be of interest to land managers, scientists, and others for study of topography, snow, ecosystems and environmental change. The Boulder Creek CZO will be using the LiDAR data to further their mission of focusing on how water, atmosphere, ecosystems, & soils interact and shape the Earth's surface. The \"Critical Zone\" lies between rock and sky. It is essential to life - including human food production - and helps drive Earth's carbon cycle, climate change, stream runoff, and water quality.<br><br>PLEASE READ the <a href=\"https://cloud.sdsc.edu/v1/AUTH_opentopography/www/metadata/BcCZO_10_SnowOff_Metadata_Reports.zip\">FGDC-compliant metadata files<\/a> that are available for each dataset (in .html, .txt, and .xml formats). These files provide numerous details that may be of interest. Also included are flight lines, survey reports, reference materials, and DEM extent shapefiles.",

This dataset covers in higher resolution sections of the rupture captured by the <a href=/gridsphere/gridsphere?gs_action='lidarDataset&cid=geonlidarframeportlet&opentopoID=OTLAS.122010.32611.1'>El Mayor-Cucapah Earthquake (4 April 2010) Rupture Lidar Scan<\/a>.  The scans were collected along the northern Borrego fault in a single day (20 April 2010) 16 days following the earthquake. This particular dataset covers a section of the rupture along a bedrock rangefront where displacements are highly concentrated along a single fault, with some localized antithetic normal slip. Depending on how the data is processed and visualized, cm- to m-scale fault scarps, fault free-face striations, displacements defined by offset geomorphic features and cm-scale alluvial fan textures, and a paleo-fault scarp are all visible. Vegetation classification was performed manually in an immersive 3D virtual reality CAVE. This dataset includes intensity-scaled point-coloring. Surveyors: Peter Gold and Austin Elliott, UC Davis",

This data was collected in collaboration between the <a href=\"http://www.ncalm.org\" target=\"_blank\">National Center for Airborne Laser Mapping (NCALM)<\/a> project and the <a href=\"http://czo.colorado.edu/\" target=\"_blank\">Boulder Creek Critical Zone Observatory (CZO)<\/a>, both funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF). The dataset contains 1 m Digital Surface Models (first-stop), Digital Terrain Models (bare-earth), and 10 points/m<sup>2<\/sup> LAS-formated point cloud tiles. The DSMs and DTMs are available in GeoTIFF format, approx. 1-2 GB each, with associated shaded relief models, for a total of 15 GB of data. The Digital Terrain Model (DTM) is a ground-surface elevation dataset better suited for derived layers such as slope angle, aspect, and contours. Accessory layers consist of index map layers for point cloud tiles, DEM extent, and flight lines. Other LiDAR DSMs, DTMs, and point cloud data available in this series include snow-on data for 2010. Together, the LiDAR Digital Elevation Models (DEM) and point cloud data will be of interest to land managers, scientists, and others for study of topography, snow, ecosystems and environmental change. The Boulder Creek CZO will be using the LiDAR data to further their mission of focusing on how water, atmosphere, ecosystems, & soils interact and shape the Earth's surface. The \"Critical Zone\" lies between rock and sky. It is essential to life - including human food production - and helps drive Earth's carbon cycle, climate change, stream runoff, and water quality.<br><br>PLEASE READ the <a href=\"https://cloud.sdsc.edu/v1/AUTH_opentopography/www/metadata/BcCZO_10_SnowOff_Metadata_Reports.zip\">FGDC-compliant metadata files<\/a> that are available for each dataset (in .html, .txt, and .xml formats).
